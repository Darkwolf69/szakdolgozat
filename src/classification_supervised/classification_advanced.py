    Perceptron (MLP) with two hidden layers on each dataset.

    Parameters:
        train_corpus (np.ndarray): Array containing training data.
        test_corpus (np.ndarray): Array containing testing data.
        train_label_nums (np.ndarray): Array containing numerical labels for training data.
        test_label_nums (np.ndarray): Array containing numerical labels for testing data.
        train_label_names (np.ndarray): Array containing label names for training data.
        test_label_names (np.ndarray): Array containing label names for testing data.
        avg_w2v_train_features (np.ndarray): Word2Vec features for training data.
        avg_w2v_test_features (np.ndarray): Word2Vec features for testing data.
        train_glove_features (np.ndarray): GloVe features for training data.
        test_glove_features (np.ndarray): GloVe features for testing data.
        avg_ft_train_features (np.ndarray): FastText features for training data.

    Returns:
        None (writes results of the classifications on the console)

    Raises:
        AttributeError: If any of the input is not a numpy array.
