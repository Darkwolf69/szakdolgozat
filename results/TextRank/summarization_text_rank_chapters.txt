 CHAPTER ONE  

The Boy Who Lived 

Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to 
say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much.
Mr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat.
As Mr 
Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the 
cat in his mirror.
Mr 
Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his 
mind.
Mr Dursley couldn't bear 
people who dressed in funny clothes – the get-ups you saw on 
young people!
But then it struck Mr Dursley that this was probably some 
silly stunt – these people were obviously collecting for something 
... yes, that would be it.
'The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard –' 
'– yes, their son, Harry –' 
Mr Dursley stopped dead.
And the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle and 
walked off.
said Mr Dursley loudly.
Was this normal 
cat behaviour, Mr Dursley wondered.
Mr Dursley 

wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name 'Potter'.
'I suppose so,' said Mrs Dursley stiffly.
'Oh, yes,' said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly.
Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly but 
Mr Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind.
His last, 
comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the 
Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near 
him and Mrs Dursley.
This 
man's name was Albus Dumbledore.
Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside 
 



 
 
his cloak and set off down the street towards number four, where 
he sat down on the wall next to the cat.
'You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day,' said 

Professor McGonagall.
'I know that,' said Professor McGonagall irritably.
She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as 
though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, 
so she went on: 'A fine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow
-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found 
out about us all.
'No, thank you,' said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though 
she didn't think this was the moment for sherbet lemons.
'As I say, 
even if You-Know-Who has gone –' 

'My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can 
call him by his name?
'I know you haven't,' said Professor McGonagall, sounding halfexasperated
, half-admiring.
Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and 

said, 'The owls are nothing to the rumours that are flying around.
'We can only guess,' said Dumbledore.
It must have 
made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his 
pocket and said, 'Hagrid's late.
'Yes,' said Professor McGonagall.
'Dumbledore – you can't.
'I would trust Hagrid with my life,' said Dumbledore.
'Hagrid,' said Dumbledore, sounding relieved.
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the 
bundle of blankets.
'Yes,' said Dumbledore.
'Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?'
Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned towards the 
Dursleys' house.
'But I c-c-can't stand it – Lily an' 
James dead – an' poor little Harry offtolive with Muggles –' 

'Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or 
we'll be found,' Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid 
gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden 
wall and walked to the front door.
For a full minute 
the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid's 
shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously and the 
twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed 
to have gone out.
'Well,' said Dumbledore finally, 'that's that.
G'night, Professor McGonagall – Professor 
Dumbledore, sir.'
'I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,' said 
Dumbledore, nodding to her.
Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street.

'Nearly,' said Harry.
Harry didn't look it, but he 
was very fast.
He had had it as long as 
he could remember and the first question he could ever remember 
asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had got it.
Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over 
the bacon.
Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen 
with his mother.
Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon.
Aunt 
Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel – Harry 
often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.
'All right, thirty-seven then,' said Dudley, going red in the face.
Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began 
wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned 
the table over.
At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to 

answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap 
the racing bike, a cine-camera, a remote-control aeroplane, sixteen 
new computer games and a video recorder.
Harry hated it there.
said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as 
though he'd planned this.
'You could just leave me here,' Harry put in hopefully (he'd be 

able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and 
maybe even have a go on Dudley's computer).
'I won't blow up the house,' said Harry, but they weren't listening.
'I suppose we could take him to the zoo,' said Aunt Petunia 

slowly, '... and leave him in the car ...' 
'That car's new, he's not sitting in it alone ...' 
Dudley began to cry loudly.
said Aunt Petunia frantically – and a moment later, Dudley's best 
friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother.
Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was 
sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on 
the way to the zoo for the first time in his life.
His aunt and uncle 
hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but 
before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.
'I'm warning you,' he had said, putting his large purple face 
right up close to Harry's, 'I'm warning you now, boy – any funny 
business, anything at all – and you'll be in that cupboard from 
now until Christmas.'
'I'm not going to do anything,' said Harry, 'honestly ...' 
But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him.
Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barber
's looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of 
kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald 
except for his fringe, which she left 'to hide that horrible scar'.
While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia.
He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the 
council, Harry, the bank and Harry were just a few of his favourite 
subjects.
'I had a dream about a motorbike,' said Harry, remembering 
suddenly.
'I know they don't,' said Harry.
Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time.
They ate in the zoo restaurant and when Dudley had a 
tantrum because his knickerbocker glory wasn't big enough, 
 



 
 
Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to 
finish the first.
Uncle Vernon tapped 
on the glass, but the snake didn't budge.
He looked back at the snake and 
winked, too.
The snake jerked its head towards Uncle Vernon and Dudley, 
then raised its eyes to the ceiling.
It gave Harry a look that said 
quite plainly: 'I get that all the time.'
'I know,' Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't 
sure the snake could hear him.
'DUDLEY!
'Out of the way, you,' he said, punching Harry in the ribs.
What 
came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened – one 
second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, 
the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.
Piers and 
Dudley could only gibber.
As far as Harry had seen, the snake 
hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it 
passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, 
Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while 
Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death.
But worst 
of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, 
'Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?'
Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house 
before starting on Harry.
At school, Harry had no one.

Dudley had a place at 
Uncle Vernon's old school, Smeltings.
'No thanks,' said Harry.
Then he ran, 
before Dudley could work out what he'd said.
One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy 
his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs Figg's.
As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle 
Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life.
Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses 
because of the smell from Harry's new uniform.
'Get the post, Dudley,' said Uncle Vernon from behind his 
paper.
'Make Harry get it.'
'Get the post, Harry.'
Harry dodged the Smeltings stick and went to get the post.
Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon's 
sister Marge, who was holidaying on the Isle of Wight, a brown 
envelope that looked like a bill and – a letter for Harry.
shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen.
Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter.
said Harry, trying to snatch it back.
sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the 

letter open with one hand and glancing at it.
Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held 

it high out of his reach.
'Vernon!
'I want to read it,' said Harry furiously, 'as it's mine.'
'Get out, both of you,' croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter 

back inside its envelope.
roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and 

Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, 
slamming the kitchen door behind them.
'But what should we do, Vernon?
Tell 
them we don't want –' 

Harry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up 
and down the kitchen.
That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did 
something he'd never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.
said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had 
squeezed through the door.
It was addressed to you by mistake,' said Uncle 
Vernon shortly.
said Harry.
The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon 

and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, 
Marge), one where Dudley slept and one where Dudley kept all 
the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom.
Uncle Vernon 
and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.
When the post arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying 
to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it.
Uncle Vernon had to 
wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which 
was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle 
Vernon around the neck from behind.
After a minute of confused 
fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smeltings stick, 
Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry's 
letter clutched in his hand.
Harry shuffled miserably 
off into the kitchen, and by the time he got back, the post 
had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap.
Uncle Vernon didn't go to work that day.
'Oh, these people's minds work in strange ways, Petunia, 

they're not like you and me,' said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock 
in a nail with the piece of fruit cake Aunt Petunia had just 
brought him.
Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him 

into the hall.
When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with 
their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut.
She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address: 
 

Mr H. Potter 
Room 17 
Railview Hotel 
Cokeworth 

 
Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his 
hand out of the way.
Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling.
Uncle Vernon was pointing at 

what looked like a large rock way out to sea.
'I've already got us some rations,' said Uncle Vernon, 'so all 
aboard!'

'An' here's Harry!'
said the giant.
he said.
'Anyway – Harry,' said the giant, turning his back on the 
Dursleys, 'a very happy birthday to yeh.
Harry looked up at the giant.
Uncle Vernon said sharply, 'Don't touch anything 
he gives you, Dudley.'
Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything
, he said, 'I'm sorry, but I still don't really know who you are.'
'Call me Hagrid,' he said, 'everyone does.
An' like I told yeh, 
I'm Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts – yeh'll know all about Hogwarts, 
o' course.'
'Er – no,' said Harry.
'Sorry,' Harry said quickly.
asked Harry.
'I know some things,' he said.
But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, 'About our world, I 

mean.
Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.
'Yeh don' know ...youdon' know ...' Hagrid ran his fingers 

through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.
said Harry eagerly.
'Ah, go boilyourheads, both of yeh,' said Hagrid.
'Harry –youra 

wizard.'
'A wizard, o' course,' said Hagrid, sitting back down on the 

sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, 'an' a thumpin' good'un, 
I'd say, once yeh've been trained up a bit.
said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, 

still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.
'He's not going,' he said.
'I'd liketosee a great Muggle like you stop him,' he said.
said Harry, interested.
'A Muggle,' said Hagrid.
said Harry.
'You knew I'm a – a wizard?'
'Well, it's bestyouknow as much as I can tellyou– mind, I 

can't tellyoueverythin', it's a great myst'ry, parts of it ...' 
He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds and 

then said, 'It begins, I suppose, with – with a person called – but 
it's incredibleyoudon't know his name, everyone in our world 
knows –' 

'Who?'
Reckon Dumbledore's the only 
one You-Know-Who was afraid of.
'Sorry,' he said.
Pointing this at Uncle 
Vernon like a sword, he said, 'I'm warning you, Dursley – I'm 
warning you – one more word ...' 

In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a 
bearded giant, Uncle Vernon's courage failed again; he flattened 
himself against the wall and fell silent.
'That's better,' said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back 
down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.
Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his 
eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite 
sure there had been a horrible mistake.
Harry looked into the fire.
Now he came to think about it ... 

every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious 
with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry 
... chased by Dudley's gang, he had somehow found himself out of 
their reach ... dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut
, he'd managed to make it grow back ... and the very last time 
Dudley had hit him, hadn't he got his revenge, without even realising 
he was doing it?
Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was 
positively beaming at him.
said Hagrid.
'Harry Potter, not a wizard – you wait, you'll 
be right famous at Hogwarts.'
asked Harry.
'It's gettin' late and we've got lotstodo tomorrow,' said Hagrid 

loudly.

'Hagrid!'
said Harry loudly.
'Flew,' said Hagrid.
'Of course not,' said Harry, eager to see more magic.
Harry asked.
'Course,' said Hagrid.
'Hagrid,' said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, 'did you 
say there are dragons at Gringotts?'
'Well, so they say,' said Hagrid.
'Good,' said Hagrid.
'Ifyouknow where to go,' said Hagrid.
If Hagrid hadn't pointed it 
 



 
 
out, Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there.
In fact, Harry had the most peculiar 
feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it.
'Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business,' said Hagrid, clapping 
his great hand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees 
buckle.
Harry didn't know what to say.
said Hagrid.
'Harry, Professor Quirrell will 
be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.'
Hagrid grinned at Harry.
'Yeah, you'll be needin' one,' said Hagrid, 'but we gotta getyour
money first.'
'Look,' Harry heard one of them 
say, 'the new Nimbus Two Thousand – fastest ever –' There were 
shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver 
instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with 
barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes, tottering piles of spell books, 
quills and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon ... 

'Gringotts,' said Hagrid.
'Like I said, yeh'd be madtotry an' rob it,' said Hagrid.
Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.
Harry asked.
'Stalagmite's got an "m" in it,' said Hagrid.
'One speed only,' said Griphook.
Harry asked.
'Yes,' said Harry.
'No,' said Harry.
'That's Hagrid,' said Harry, pleased to know something the boy 
didn't.
'He's the gamekeeper,' said Harry.
said Hagrid.
When they had left the shop, he 
said, 'Hagrid, what's Quidditch?'
While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of 
some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined 
silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, 
glittery black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).
A magic wand ... this was what Harry had been really looking 
forward to.
Harry Potter.'
'It was, sir, yes,' said Hagrid.
'Oh, no, sir,' said Hagrid quickly.
'Er – well, I'm right-handed,' said Harry.
Harry tried.
Harry took the wand.
'You all right, Harry?

'I don't know,' said Harry, realising this for the first time.
Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that 
left at eleven o'clock, but the guard said there wasn't one.
'I'm not Fred, I'm George,' said the boy.
'Yes,' said Harry.
'Er – OK,' said Harry.
said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry's 

lightning scar.
said Harry.
'Oh, him,' said Harry.
said one of 

the twins.
'Shut up,' said Ron.
said their mother.
said one of the 

twins.
'Shut up,' said Ron again.
'Bye,' said Harry and Ron.
'Oh – well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George's 

jokes,' said Ron.
'Yes,' said Harry, 'but I can't remember it.'
said Ron eagerly.
'Wow,' said Ron.
'Er – yes, I think so,' said Ron.
'Five,' said Ron.
said Harry.
'You said You-Know-Who's name!'
'Go 
on –' 

'You don't want this, it's all dry,' said Ron.
'No,' said Ron.
said Harry.
said Ron.
said Ron.
'Help yourself,' said Harry.
'He'll turn up,' said Harry.
'Don't know why he's so bothered,' said Ron.
'Harry Potter,' said Harry.
'Gryffindor,' said Ron.
'Yeah,' said Ron.
'You know, I think the ends of Scabbers's whiskers are a bit 

lighter,' said Harry, trying to take Ron's mind off houses.
he said.
'Yes,' said Harry.
He turned back to Harry.
Both Harry and Ron stood up.
'I think he's been knocked out,' Ron said to Harry.
All right there, Harry?'

'The firs'-years, Professor McGonagall,' said Hagrid.
Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a 
doorway to the right – the rest of the school must already be here 
– but Professor McGonagall showed the first-years into a small 
empty chamber off the hall.
'Welcome to Hogwarts,' said Professor McGonagall.
'The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw 
and Slytherin.
'I shall return when we are ready for you,' said Professor 
McGonagall.
Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got 

into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and 
they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall and through 
a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.
Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall 
silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first-years.
Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought 
wildly, that seemed the sort of thing – noticing that everyone in 
 



 
 
the Hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it too.
Ron whispered to Harry.
If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who 
felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.
'When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the 
stool to be sorted,' she said.
shouted the hat.
'Brocklehurst, Mandy' went to Ravenclaw too, but 'Brown, 
Lavender' became the first new Gryffindor and the table on the far 
left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers 
catcalling.
Perhaps it was 
Harry's imagination, after all he'd heard about Slytherin, but he 
thought they looked an unpleasant lot.
Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at 
once, but at others it took a little while to decide.
'Finnigan, 
Seamus', the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the 
stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a 
Gryffindor.
shouted the hat.
What 
if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until 
Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had 
obviously been a mistake and he'd better get back on the train?
'The Harry Potter?'
The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes 

was the Hall full of people craning to get a good look at him.
Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole Hall.
Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a 
second later the hat had shouted, 'GRYFFINDOR!'
'Well done, Ron, excellent,' said Percy Weasley pompously 
across Harry as 'Zabini, Blaise' was made a Slytherin.
Professor 
McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.
he said.
said Percy airily.
said Ron suddenly.
Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible 
ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face and robes 
stained with silver blood.
'I've never asked,' said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.
said Ron.
'Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch,' said Neville, 

'but the family thought I was all Muggle for ages.
On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking 
about lessons ('I do hope they start straight away, there's so 
much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you 
know, turning something into something else, of course, it's 
 



 
 
supposed to be very difficult –'; 'You'll be starting small, just 
matches into needles and that sort of thing –').
Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore.
Harry clapped a hand to his head.
Harder to shake 

off was the feeling Harry had got from the teacher's look – a feeling 
that he didn't like Harry at all.
Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.
'Must be,' said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore.
The Gryffindor first-years followed Percy through the chattering 
crowds, out of the Great Hall and up the marble staircase.
she said.
Harry told the turban he didn't 
want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull 
it off but it tightened painfully – and there was Malfoy, laughing at 
him as he struggled with it – then Malfoy turned into the hooknosed 
teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold – there 
was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.

Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory 
next day People queuing outside classrooms stood on tiptoe 
to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors 
again, staring.
Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of 
him on their very first morning.
Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron.
'Double Potions with the Slytherins,' said Ron.
'Wish McGonagall favoured us,' said Harry.
Dear Harry, (it said, in a very untidy scrawl) 

I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to 
come and have a cup of tea with me around three?
Hagrid 
 

Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled 'Yes, please, see you later' on 
the back of the note and sent Hedwig off again.
It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, 
because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that 
had happened to him so far.
At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had got the idea that 
Professor Snape disliked him.
Snape didn't dislike Harry – he 
hated him.
Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the register, and 
like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name.
'Ah, yes,' he said softly, 'Harry Potter.
His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had 
none of Hagrid's warmth.
said Snape suddenly.
Harry glanced at 
Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione's hand had shot 
into the air.
'I don't know, sir,' said Harry.
Potter, where would you look if I told you to 

find me a bezoar?'
Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go 

without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have the faintest 
idea what a bezoar was.
'I don't know,' said Harry quietly.
Over 
the noise, Snape said, 'And a point will be taken from Gryffindor 
house for your cheek, Potter.'
Then 

he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to 
Neville.
He'd lost two 
points for Gryffindor in his very first week – why did Snape hate 
him so much?
'Cheer up,' said Ron.
'Make yerselves at home,' said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who 
bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears.
Like Hagrid, 
Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.
'This is Ron,' Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water 
into a large teapot and putting rock cakes on to a plate.
said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles.
The rock cakes almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron 
pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their 
first lessons.
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch 'that old 
git'.
Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson.
Hagrid, like Ron, told 
Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the 
students.
said Hagrid.
Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet 

his eyes when he said that.
Hagrid asked Ron.
While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, 
Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under 
the tea cosy.
'Hagrid!'
said Harry.
There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet 
Harry's eyes this time.
As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their 
pockets weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to 
refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had 
given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid.
And did 
Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn't want to tell 
Harry?

'Typical,' said Harry darkly.
Harry and Ron jumped to their feet.
'Malfoy's got my Remembrall, Professor.'
Perhaps brooms, like 
horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was 
a quaver in Neville's voice that said only too clearly that he wanted 
to keep his feet on the ground.
Harry and Ron were delighted when she 
told Malfoy he'd been doing it wrong for years.
'Give that here, Malfoy,' said Harry quietly.
Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; 
Harry made a sharp about turn and held the broom steady.
'HARRY POTTER!'
Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle's triumphant 

 



 
 
faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake 
as she strode towards the castle.
thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was 
going to use on him?
'Follow me, you two,' said Professor McGonagall, and they 
marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.
'He's just the build for a Seeker, too,' said Wood, now walking 

around Harry and staring at him.
Harry had just finished telling Ron what 

had happened when he'd left the grounds with Professor 
McGonagall.
he said.
You must be good, Harry, Wood was 
almost skipping when he told us.'
'You're a lot braver now you're back on the ground and you've 
got your little friends with you,' said Harry coolly.
'I'd take you on any time on my own,' said Malfoy.
'Crabbe,' he said.
When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.
said Harry.
said Ron.
'And it's really none of your business,' said Harry.
'Goodbye,' said Ron.
There was a very good chance they were 
going to get caught by Filch or Mrs Norris, and Harry felt he was 
pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today.
said Ron furiously.
'Come on,' he said to Ron.
'That's your problem,' said Ron.
'You've got some nerve –' said Ron loudly.
said Harry sharply.
said Harry.
said Neville, scrambling to his feet.
Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione 

 



 
 
and Neville.
Harry yelled and the four of them sprinted down the 
gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following – 
they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor 
then another, Harry in the lead without any idea where they were 
 



 
 
or where they were going.
'We've got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,' said Ron, 'quickly 
as possible.'
'Malfoy tricked you,' Hermione said to Harry.
He was never going to meet you – Filch knew someone 
was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him 
off.'
Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn't going to 
tell her that.
'Should tell Filch, I should,' said Peeves in a saintly voice, but 

his eyes glittered wickedly.
said Ron finally.
But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as 

he climbed back into bed.

 TEN  
 

Hallowe'en 
 

Malfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron 
were still at Hogwarts next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful
.
'Or both,' said Harry.
Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she 
was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added 
bonus.
'It's not any old broomstick,' he said, 'it's a Nimbus Two 

Thousand.
Ron grinned at Harry.
'Potter's been sent a broomstick, Professor,' said Malfoy quickly.
'Yes, yes, that's right,' said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.
'A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,' said Harry, fighting not to laugh 
at the look of horror on Malfoy's face.
said Harry.
'Yes, don't stop now,' said Ron, 'it's doing us so much good.'
'Right,' said Wood.
'This ball's called the Quaffle,' said Wood.
'Never mind,' said Harry quickly.
'Three Chasers, one Keeper,' said Harry, who was determined to 
remember it all.
'I'll show you now,' said Wood.
'I'm going to show you what the Bludgers do,' Wood said.
'Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper 
guards the goalposts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from 
their team,' Harry reeled off.
'Very good,' said Wood.
Ron, however, was to be 
working with Hermione Granger.
'It's no wonder no one can stand her,' he said to Harry as they 

pushed their way into the crowded corridor.
It was 
Hermione.
said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable.
On their way down to the Great Hall for the 
Hallowe'en feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling 
her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' toilets 
and wanted to be left alone.
'How could a troll get in?'
'He's heading for the third floor,' Harry said, but Ron held up 

his hand.
'Hermione!'
Harry said desperately to Ron, and seizing a tap he 
threw it as hard as he could against the wall.
The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione.
The troll couldn't feel 
Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long 
bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wand had still been in his 
hand when he'd jumped – it had gone straight up one of the troll's 
nostrils.
Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his 
own wand – not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself 
cry the first spell that came into his head: 'Wingardium 
Leviosa!'
Harry got to his feet.
'I don't think so,' said Harry.
Professor McGonagall was looking at 
Ron and Harry.
Harry looked at Ron, 
who was still standing with his wand in the air.
Harry looked at the 
floor.
Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.
Harry stuck his wand 

up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club.
'Well – in that case ...' said Professor McGonagall, staring at the 
three of them.
'Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for 
this,' said Professor McGonagall.
Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.

Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping.
'He's just made that rule up,' Harry muttered angrily as Snape 

limped away.
Harry, 
Ron and Hermione sat together next to a window.
Hermione was 
checking Harry and Ron's Charms homework for them.
Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was 
going to ask Snape if he could have it.
'Rather you than me,' they said together, but Harry had an idea 
that Snape wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening.
Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from 

Gryffindor.
Ron asked as Harry joined them.
'No – he wouldn't,' she said.
'I'm with Harry.
He tried 
to empty his mind – he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first 
Quidditch match in a few hours – but the expression on Snape's 
face when Harry had seen his leg wasn't easy to forget.
'Shut up, you two,' said Wood.
'And she's really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia 

Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood's, last year only a reserve – 
back to Johnson and – no, Slytherin have taken the Quaffle, 
Slytherin captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes – 
Flint flying like an eagle up there – he's going to sc– no, stopped 
by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and Gryffindor 
take the Quaffle – that's Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice 
dive around Flint, off up the field and – OUCH – that must have 
hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger – Quaffle taken by 
Slytherin – that's Adrian Pucey speeding off towards the goalposts, 
but he's blocked by a second Bludger – sent his way by Fred or 
George Weasley, can't tell which – nice play by the Gryffindor 
Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a 
clear field ahead and off she goes – she's really flying – dodges a 
speeding Bludger – the goalposts are ahead – come on, now, 
Angelina – Keeper Bletchley dives – misses – GRYFFINDOR 
SCORE!'
Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough 

space to join them.
'Nope,' said Ron.
'Kept outta trouble, though, that's somethin',' said Hagrid, 

raising his binoculars and peering skywards at the speck that was 
Harry.
'Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,' Wood 
had said.
'All right there, Harry?'
Harry saw it.
A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below – 
Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose and Harry's broom 
span off course, Harry holding on for dear life.
Harry tried to turn back towards 
the Gryffindor goalposts; he had half a mind to ask Wood to call 
time out – and then he realised that his broom was completely out 
of his control.
No one seemed to have noticed 
that Harry's broom was behaving strangely.
'If I didn' know better, I'd say he'd 
lost control of his broom ... but he can't have ...' 

Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands.
Harry's 
broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it.
At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid's binoculars, but 
instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at 
the crowd.
'He's doing something – jinxing the broom,' said Hermione.
Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry.
The whole crowd were on their feet, watching, terrified
, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely on to one 
of their brooms, but it was no good – every time they got near 
him, the broom would jump higher still.
Scooping 
the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket she scrambled back 
along the row – Snape would never know what had happened.
Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber 
back on to his broom.
Ron said.
He was being made a 
cup of strong tea back in Hagrid's hut, with Ron and Hermione.
'It was Snape,' Ron was explaining.
Harry, Ron and Hermione looked at each other, wondering 
what to tell him.
he said.
said Harry eagerly.
'Rubbish,' said Hagrid again.
said Hagrid hotly.
'I don' know why 
 



 
 
Harry's broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn' try an' kill a student
!
said Harry.

'I'll get him,' said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy's back, 'one 
of these days, I'll get him –' 

'I hate them both,' said Harry, 'Malfoy and Snape.'
'Come on, cheer up, it's nearly Christmas,' said Hagrid.
So Harry, Ron and Hermione followed Hagrid and his tree off to 

the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor 
Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations.
'Just one,' said Hermione.
'And that reminds me – Harry, Ron, 

we've got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library,' 
'Oh yeah, you're right,' said Ron, tearing his eyes away from 

Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his 
wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.
'We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all,' said 
Hermione.
'Just have to find out for ourselves, then,' said Ron, and they 

left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.
'Nothing,' said Harry.
said 
Hermione.
'And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,' 
said Ron.
* 

Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too 
good a time to think much about Flamel.
'Happy Christmas,' said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of 
bed and pulled on his dressing-gown.
'You too,' said Harry.
'That's friendly,' said Harry.
he said.
'You can keep it,' said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was.
'I think I know who that one's from,' said Ron, going a bit pink 

and pointing to a very lumpy parcel.
'It's an Invisibility Cloak,' said Ron, a look of awe on his face.
said Ron suddenly.
'I'd give anything for one of these,' he said.
'Nothing,' said Harry.
'Hey, look – Harry's got a Weasley jumper, too!'
Get it on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing ours, 
even Harry got one.'
Harry said nothing.
It 
stuck up at the back, just like Harry's did.
And slowly, Harry looked 

into the faces of the other people in the mirror and saw other 
pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old 
man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees – Harry 
was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.
'I'd like to see your mum and dad,' Ron said eagerly.
'You can see them any old time,' said Ron.
said Ron.
'I'm freezing,' said Ron.
Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he 

couldn't see his family any more, just Ron in his paisley pyjamas.
he said.
And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.
said Ron.
'No ... you go ...' 
'I know what you're thinking about, Harry, that mirror.
But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get 

back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him.
Except – 
'So – back again, Harry?'
Harry thought.
Harry stood up.
'What do you see when you look in the Mirror?'

'You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you 
mad,' said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.
The rest of the team hung back to talk to each other as usual at 
the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the 
Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione 
playing chess.
Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, 
something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.
'Don't talk to me for a moment,' said Ron when Harry sat down 
next to him.
'Don't play,' said Hermione at once.
'Really break your leg,' said Ron.
'I can't,' said Harry.
Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit 
with Harry and Ron.
'Malfoy,' said Neville shakily.
said Ron.
'You're worth twelve of Malfoy,' Harry said.
'Dumbledore again,' he said.
Then he looked 

up at Ron and Hermione.
said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she'd 
looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the 
pages, muttering to herself.
said Ron grumpily.
said Harry and Ron.
said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished.
said Harry.
It wasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch 
team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.
I'm going to play,' he told Ron and Hermione.
Could Snape possibly 
know they'd found out about the Philosopher's Stone?
Harry 
didn't see how he could – yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling 
that Snape could read minds.
* 
Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the changing 
rooms next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering 
whether they'd ever see him alive again.
Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been 
secretly practising the Leg-Locker Curse.
They'd got the idea from 
Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he 
showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.
'I've never seen Snape look so mean,' he told Hermione.
Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still 

not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, 'You tell him, 
Neville.'
said Hermione suddenly.
'Harry –!'
said Malfoy.
Hermione screamed, leaping on to her seat 
to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape – she didn't even notice 
Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and 
yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe and 
Goyle.
'Ron!
Ron!
Harry's won!
'Well done,' said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could 
hear.
* 
'Harry where have you been?'
shouted Ron, thumping Harry on 
the back.
'Never mind that now,' said Harry breathlessly.
He asked if he knew how 
to get past Fluffy – and he said something about Quirrell's "hocuspocus
" – I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart 
from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would 
have done some anti-Dark Arts spell which Snape needs to break 
through –' 

'So you mean the Stone's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up 
to Snape?'
said Hermione in alarm.

'There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of 
fact,' said Harry, 'about what's guarding the Stone apart from 
Fluffy –' 

'SHHHH!'
said Hagrid again.
They'll think 
I've toldyou–' 

'See you later, then,' said Harry.
said Hermione thoughtfully
.
'Hagrid's always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I 
ever met him,' said Harry.
'But it's against our laws,' said Ron.
said Harry.
'Of course there are,' said Ron.
said Hermione.
'Yes,' said Harry.
'Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do 
know, you know everything that goes on round here,' said 
Hermione in a warm, flattering voice.
Harry and Ron 
beamed at Hermione.
Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he 

was.
'You're the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy, aren't 
you, Hagrid?'
said Harry anxiously.
'Can't, Harry, sorry,' said Hagrid.
Harry looked at it, too.
'Hagrid – what's that?'
said Ron, crouching over the 

fire to get a closer look at the egg.
'Won it,' said Hagrid.
said 
Hermione.
Hermione had now started making revision 
timetables for Harry and Ron, too.
Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology, and in the 
end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid's with the other two 
during morning break.
said Hagrid.
* 
Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy's face during the 
next week made Harry, Ron and Hermione very nervous.
'I can't,' said Hagrid.
'I've decided to call him Norbert,' said Hagrid, looking at the 
dragon with misty eyes.
'Hagrid,' said Harry loudly, 'give it a fortnight and Norbert's 

going to be as long as your house.
Harry suddenly turned to Ron.
'Charlie,' he said.
'You're losing it, too,' said Ron.
said Ron.
'How about it, Hagrid?'
said Harry, hurrying to let her in.
'We've got the Invisibility Cloak,' said Harry.
Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.
'It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday,' said Hermione, but 

this didn't soothe Ron at all.
Harry and Hermione didn't get a chance to answer.
'We 
haven't got time to send Charlie another owl and this could be 
our only chance to get rid of Norbert.
Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered 
the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath 
it themselves.

'Harry!'
'I 
was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was 
going to catch you, he said you had a drag–' 

Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but 
Professor McGonagall had seen.
'I think I've got a good idea of what's been going on,' said 
Professor McGonagall.
said Harry miserably.
Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing 
Ron on Astronomy.
said Ron.
So what do we do, Harry?'
said Harry.
All 
right, Harry, Hermione?'
said Hagrid, frowning at Filch.
'I'm not going in that Forest,' he said, and Harry was pleased to 

hear the note of panic in his voice.
'Look there,' said Hagrid, 'see that stuff shinin' on the ground?
'All right, but I warn yeh, he's a coward,' said Hagrid.
'So me, 

Harry an' Hermione'll go one way an' Draco, Neville an' Fang'll go 
the other.
A little way into it they 
reached a fork in the earth path and Harry, Hermione and Hagrid 
took the left path while Malfoy, Neville and Fang took the right.
Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.
'You all right, Hermione?'
'That wasn' no werewolf an' it wasn' no unicorn, neither,' said 

Hagrid grimly.
'Oh, it's you, Ronan,' said Hagrid in relief.
'Good evening to you, Hagrid,' said Ronan.
'Can't be too careful, Ronan,' said Hagrid, patting his crossbow.
This is Harry Potter an' 
Hermione Granger, by the way.
'Good evening,' said Ronan.
'Yeah,' said Hagrid, 'but haveyouseen anythin', Ronan?
'Hullo, Bane,' said Hagrid.
'We've heard,' said Hagrid grumpily.
'Never,' said Hagrid irritably, 'try an' get a straight answer out of 
a centaur.
said Harry.
'Hagrid!
Right, we're changin' groups – Neville, you stay with 
me an' Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an' this idiot.
So Harry set off into the heart of the Forest with Malfoy and 
Fang.
The 

hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry – unicorn 
blood was dribbling down its front.
said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.
'You had better get back to 
Hagrid.
said Firenze.
And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best 
he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane 
behind them.
'Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?'
Harry, are you all right?'
'The 

unicorn's dead, Hagrid, it's in that clearing back there.'
'Good luck, Harry Potter,' said Firenze.

'I'm not ill,' said Harry.
'I've just thought of something,' said Harry.
'Yes, please,' said Ron, but Harry cut across him.
'We've got to go to Dumbledore,' said Harry.
'We want to see Professor Dumbledore,' said Hermione, rather 

bravely, Harry and Ron thought.
said Harry frantically.
'It's obvious,' said Ron.
Harry said.
said Ron.
said Hermione.
'You're right, Harry,' said Hermione in a small voice.
said Ron.
'No, no, no,' said Hermione.
'You can't go out,' said Neville, 'you'll be caught again.
said Neville.
Harry turned to Hermione.
'We had to, Neville, no time to explain,' said Harry.
'Well, there you are,' Harry said quietly.
'We're coming,' said Hermione.
said Ron.
'Right,' said Ron.
said Hermione.
said Ron.
'Probably,' said Harry.
said Ron.
Harry said suddenly, 'they're keys!
said Ron.
'I think,' said Ron, 'we're going to have to be chessmen.'
'I suppose we've got to 

take the place of three of the black pieces ...' 
Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think.
'I'm going to be a knight,' said Ron.
With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and 
Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway.
'Snape's,' said Harry.
'Of course not,' said Hermione.
'Got it,' she said.
'You drink that,' said Harry.
'But Harry – what if You-Know-Who's with him?'
'I'm not as good as you,' said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let 

go of him.
said Hermione.
'You drink first,' said Harry.
said Harry anxiously.

'Of course,' said Quirrell coolly.
I'll be 
far away by the time he gets back ...' 

All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and 
stop him concentrating on the Mirror.
'Yes,' said Quirrell idly, walking around the Mirror to look at 

the back.
'I see the Stone ...
said Quirrell impatiently.
Where there should have been a back to Quirrell's head, there was 
a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen.
the face said.
Quirrell was walking backwards at him, so that Voldemort 

could still see him.
shrieked Voldemort again and Quirrell 
lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of him, 
both hands around Harry's neck – Harry's scar was almost blinding 
him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.
And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his 

knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms 
– Harry could see they looked burnt, raw, red and shiny.
Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering too, and then Harry 

knew: Quirrell couldn't touch his bare skin, not without suffering 
terrible pain – his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep 
him in enough pain to stop him doing a curse.
Quirrell screamed and tried to throw 
Harry off – the pain in Harry's head was building – he couldn't see 
– he could only hear Quirrell's terrible shrieks and Voldemort's 
yells of 'KILL HIM!
Harry!'
'Good afternoon, Harry,' said Dumbledore.
It 

was Quirrell!
'Quirrell does not have the Stone.'
said Harry blankly.
Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry's face.
said Harry.
'No, Harry, he has not.
'Quirrell said Snape –' 
'Professor Snape, Harry.'
'Yes, him – Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my 

father.
'Yes ...' said Dumbledore dreamily.
'Harry!'
'Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to – Dumbledore was 

so worried –' 
'The whole school's talking about it,' said Ron.
Harry told 
them everything: Quirrell; the Mirror; the Stone and Voldemort.
Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all 
the right places and, when Harry told them what was under 
Quirrell's turban, Hermione screamed out loud.
said Harry.
'Well, I got back all right,' said Hermione.
He 
already knew – he just said, "Harry's gone after him, hasn't he?"
said Ron.
'No, it isn't,' said Harry thoughtfully.
'Oh good,' said Harry.
'Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,' said Dumbledore.
'Third – to Mr Harry Potter ...' said Dumbledore.
'Thanks,' said Harry.
'Not where I'm going, I promise you,' said Harry.
'Harry Potter!'
she said.
'Very,' said Harry.
