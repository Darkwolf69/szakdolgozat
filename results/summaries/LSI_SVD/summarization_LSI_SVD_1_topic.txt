said Mr Dursley loudly.
'No,' she said sharply.
'Harry.
'I know that,' said Professor McGonagall irritably.
I know ...' he said heavily.
'We can only guess,' said Dumbledore.
'Yes,' said Professor McGonagall.
'I would trust Hagrid with my life,' said Dumbledore.
'Hagrid,' said Dumbledore, sounding relieved.
'Yes,' said Dumbledore.
'Well,' said Dumbledore finally, 'that's that.
'Yeah,' said Hagrid in a very muffled voice.
'Nearly,' said Harry.
Aunt 
Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel – Harry 
often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.
said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as 
though he'd planned this.
'I won't blow up the house,' said Harry, but they weren't listening.
'I'm not going to do anything,' said Harry, 'honestly ...' 
But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him.
'I had a dream about a motorbike,' said Harry, remembering 
suddenly.
'I know they don't,' said Harry.
But he wished he hadn't said anything.
It gave Harry a look that said 
quite plainly: 'I get that all the time.'
Harry asked.
'Out of the way, you,' he said, punching Harry in the ribs.
'No thanks,' said Harry.
'Oh,' he said.
said Dudley suddenly.
said Harry, trying to snatch it back.
'I want to read it,' said Harry furiously, 'as it's mine.'
'No,' he said finally.
said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had 
squeezed through the door.
'It was not a mistake,' said Harry angrily.
said Harry.
he said.
he said cheerfully
.
he said stupidly.
'An' here's Harry!'
said the giant.
he said.
'Call me Hagrid,' he said, 'everyone does.
'Er – no,' said Harry.
'Sorry,' Harry said quickly.
asked Harry.
'I know some things,' he said.
he said finally.
said Harry eagerly.
'He's not going,' he said.
said Harry, interested.
'A Muggle,' said Hagrid.
said Harry.
'Sorry,' he said.
said Hagrid.
asked Harry.
'You can kip under that,' he said.
said Harry loudly.
'Flew,' said Hagrid.
'Of course not,' said Harry, eager to see more magic.
Harry asked.
'Course,' said Hagrid.
'Hagrid,' said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, 'did you 
say there are dragons at Gringotts?'
'Well, so they say,' said Hagrid.
'Good,' said Hagrid.
'Ifyouknow where to go,' said Hagrid.
'Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business,' said Hagrid, clapping 
his great hand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees 
buckle.
'Good Lord,' said the barman, peering at Harry, 'is this – can 
this be –?'
Harry didn't know what to say.
said Hagrid.
Come on, Harry.'
'Like I said, yeh'd be madtotry an' rob it,' said Hagrid.
'Morning,' said Hagrid to a free goblin.
Harry asked.
'Stalagmite's got an "m" in it,' said Hagrid.
Harry asked.
she said, when Harry started to speak.
'Yes,' said Harry.
'No,' said Harry.
'No,' Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch 

could be.
'No,' said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.
'Mmm,' said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more 
interesting.
'That's Hagrid,' said Harry, pleased to know something the boy 
didn't.
'Oh,' said the boy, 'I've heard of him.
'He's the gamekeeper,' said Harry.
'I think he's brilliant,' said Harry coldly.
'They're dead,' said Harry shortly.
But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, 'That's you 
done, my dear,' and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking 
to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.
said Hagrid.
When they had left the shop, he 
said, 'Hagrid, what's Quidditch?'
'Don't make me feel worse,' said Harry.
'Don' mention it,' said Hagrid gruffly.
'Hello,' said Harry awkwardly.
'Ah yes,' said the man.
Harry Potter.'
'It was, sir, yes,' said Hagrid.
'Oh, no, sir,' said Hagrid quickly.
'Er – well, I'm right-handed,' said Harry.
Harry tried.
'You all right, Harry?
Yer very quiet,' said Hagrid.
'I don't know,' said Harry, realising this for the first time.
said the boys' mother.
'I'm not Fred, I'm George,' said the boy.
'Excuse me,' Harry said to the plump woman.
'Yes,' said Harry.
she said kindly, and Harry 
nodded.
'Not to worry,' she said.
'Er – OK,' said Harry.
'Thanks,' said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.
said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry's 

lightning scar.
'He is,' said the first twin.
said Harry.
'Oh, him,' said Harry.
said one of 

the twins.
'Shut up,' said Ron.
said their mother.
'You should have said something, we had no 
idea.'
said one of the 

twins.
'Shut up,' said Ron again.
'Harry Potter!'
'Harry,' said the other twin, 'did we introduce ourselves?
'Bye,' said Harry and Ron.
'Oh – well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George's 

jokes,' said Ron.
'Yes,' said Harry, 'but I can't remember it.'
said Ron eagerly.
'Wow,' said Ron.
asked Harry, who found Ron just 
as interesting as Ron found him.
'Er – yes, I think so,' said Ron.
'I heard you went to live with Muggles,' said Ron.
'Five,' said Ron.
said Harry.
'You said You-Know-Who's name!'
said Ron, sounding both 

shocked and impressed.
'I'd have thought you, of all people –' 
'I'm not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,' said 

Harry.
'Swap you for one of these,' said Harry, holding up a pasty.
'Go 
on –' 

'You don't want this, it's all dry,' said Ron.
'No,' said Ron.
said Harry.
said Ron.
said Ron.
'Help yourself,' said Harry.
'He'll turn up,' said Harry.
'Yes,' said the boy miserably.
'Don't know why he's so bothered,' said Ron.
'He might have died and you wouldn't know the difference,' 

said Ron in disgust.
Neville's lost one,' she said.
said the girl.
She said all this very fast.
'Harry Potter,' said Harry.
said Hermione.
said Harry, feeling dazed.
'Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I 

could if it was me,' said Hermione.
'Whatever house I'm in, I hope she's not in it,' said Ron.
asked Harry.
'Gryffindor,' said Ron.
'Yeah,' said Ron.
'You know, I think the ends of Scabbers's whiskers are a bit 

lighter,' said Harry, trying to take Ron's mind off houses.
he said.
'Yes,' said Harry.
Both Harry and Ron stood up.
'Say that again,' he said.
'Unless you get out now,' said Harry, more bravely than he felt, 

because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.
'I think he's been knocked out,' Ron said to Harry.
'I've heard of his family,' said Ron darkly.
Said they'd been bewitched.
All right there, Harry?'
Harry and Ron were 
followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione.
'The firs'-years, Professor McGonagall,' said Hagrid.
said the Friar.
Ron whispered to Harry.
'The Harry Potter?'
said the small voice.
he said.
said Ron suddenly.
'Like this,' he said irritably.
said Ron.
she said.
'Double Potions with the Slytherins,' said Ron.
'Wish McGonagall favoured us,' said Harry.
'Ah, yes,' he said softly, 'Harry Potter.
said Snape suddenly.
'I don't know, sir,' said Harry.
'I don't know,' said Harry quietly.
'Cheer up,' said Ron.
'Hang on,' he said.
said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles.
said Hagrid.
Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet 

his eyes when he said that.
Hagrid asked Ron.
said Harry.
'Typical,' said Harry darkly.
'You don't know you'll make a fool of yourself,' said Ron reasonably
.
Harry and Ron jumped to their feet.
'Give that here, Malfoy,' said Harry quietly.
'HARRY POTTER!'
'Follow me, you two,' said Professor McGonagall, and they 
marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.
'He's just the build for a Seeker, too,' said Wood, now walking 

around Harry and staring at him.
he said.
'I start training next week,' said Harry.
'You're a lot braver now you're back on the ground and you've 
got your little friends with you,' said Harry coolly.
'I'd take you on any time on my own,' said Malfoy.
'Of course he has,' said Ron, wheeling round.
'Crabbe,' he said.
When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.
said Harry.
said Ron.
'And it's really none of your business,' said Harry.
'Goodbye,' said Ron.
said Ron furiously.
'Come on,' he said to Ron.
'That's your problem,' said Ron.
'I'm coming with you,' she said.
'You've got some nerve –' said Ron loudly.
said Harry sharply.
said Harry.
'We've got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,' said Ron, 'quickly 
as possible.'
'Malfoy tricked you,' Hermione said to Harry.
It was a while before any of them said anything.
said Ron finally.
'No, we don't mind,' he said.
The dog was guarding something ... 
What had Hagrid said?
'Or both,' said Harry.
Ron grinned at Harry.
'Yes, yes, that's right,' said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.
said Harry.
'Yes, don't stop now,' said Ron, 'it's doing us so much good.'
'Right,' said Wood.
said Wood curiously.
'Never mind,' said Harry quickly.
'Three Chasers, one Keeper,' said Harry, who was determined to 
remember it all.
'I'll show you now,' said Wood.
'Very good,' said Wood.
'It's no wonder no one can stand her,' he said to Harry as they 

pushed their way into the crowded corridor.
said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable.
'Don't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid,' said Ron.
'He's heading for the third floor,' Harry said, but Ron held up 

his hand.
'Good idea,' said Ron nervously.
'Oh, no,' said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.
they said together.
Harry said desperately to Ron, and seizing a tap he 
threw it as hard as he could against the wall.
'I don't think so,' said Harry.
Professor McGonagall was looking at 
Ron and Harry.
Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.
Harry, 
Ron and Hermione sat together next to a window.
Ron asked as Harry joined them.
'No – he wouldn't,' she said.
'I'm with Harry.
'Harry, you need your strength,' said Seamus Finnigan.
'The one we've all been waiting for,' said George.
'Shut up, you two,' said Wood.
'Nope,' said Ron.
'All right there, Harry?'
Harry saw it.
'Can't have,' Hagrid said, his voice shaking.
'He's doing something – jinxing the broom,' said Hermione.
Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry.
Ron said.
Harry, Ron and Hermione looked at each other, wondering 
what to tell him.
he said.
said Harry eagerly.
'Now, don't ask me any more,' said Hagrid gruffly.
'Rubbish,' said Hagrid again.
said Hagrid hotly.
said Harry.
'I'll get him,' said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy's back, 'one 
of these days, I'll get him –' 

'I hate them both,' said Harry, 'Malfoy and Snape.'
'Come on, cheer up, it's nearly Christmas,' said Hagrid.
'Just one,' said Hermione.
said Hagrid, following them out of the Hall.
'We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all,' said 
Hermione.
'Just have to find out for ourselves, then,' said Ron, and they 

left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.
'Nothing,' said Harry.
said 
Hermione.
'And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,' 
said Ron.
'Very safe, as they're both dentists,' said Hermione.
'Happy Christmas,' said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of 
bed and pulled on his dressing-gown.
'You too,' said Harry.
said Ron, turning to his own 
pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry's.
'That's friendly,' said Harry.
he said.
'You can keep it,' said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was.
'I think I know who that one's from,' said Ron, going a bit pink 

and pointing to a very lumpy parcel.
'That's really nice of her,' said Harry, trying the fudge, which 
was very tasty.
'It's an Invisibility Cloak,' said Ron, a look of awe on his face.
said Ron suddenly.
'I'd give anything for one of these,' he said.
'Nothing,' said Harry.
Use it well, the 
note had said.
Harry said nothing.
* 
'You could have woken me up,' said Ron, crossly.
'I'd like to see your mum and dad,' Ron said eagerly.
'You can see them any old time,' said Ron.
said Ron.
'I'm freezing,' said Ron.
he said.
And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.
said Ron.
Harry thought.
Then he said slowly, 'It shows us what we want 
... whatever we want ...' 

'Yes and no,' said Dumbledore quietly.
'You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you 
mad,' said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.
'It's not my fault,' said Wood.
'Don't talk to me for a moment,' said Ron when Harry sat down 
next to him.
'Don't play,' said Hermione at once.
'Say you're ill,' said Ron.
'Really break your leg,' said Ron.
'I can't,' said Harry.
Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit 
with Harry and Ron.
'Malfoy,' said Neville shakily.
said Ron.
'You're worth twelve of Malfoy,' Harry said.
'Dumbledore again,' he said.
Then he looked 

up at Ron and Hermione.
said Ron grumpily.
said Harry and Ron.
said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished.
said Harry.
It wasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch 
team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.
'Just as long as we're not wiping you off the pitch,' said 
Hermione.
said Hermione suddenly.
'Harry –!'
said Malfoy.
'Come on, Harry!'
'Ron!
Ron!
Harry's won!
'Well done,' said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could 
hear.
* 
'Harry where have you been?'
'Never mind that now,' said Harry breathlessly.
said Hermione in alarm.
'It'll be gone by next Tuesday,' said Ron.
said Hagrid again.
They'll think 
I've toldyou–' 

'See you later, then,' said Harry.
said Hermione thoughtfully
.
'I'm going to see what section he was in,' said Ron, who'd had 

enough of working.
'Hagrid's always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I 
ever met him,' said Harry.
'But it's against our laws,' said Ron.
said Harry.
'Of course there are,' said Ron.
said Hermione.
'Yes,' said Harry.
'O' course I can't,' he said.
Harry and Ron 
beamed at Hermione.
Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he 

was.
said Harry anxiously.
'Can't, Harry, sorry,' said Hagrid.
Harry looked at it, too.
'Won it,' said Hagrid.
said 
Hermione.
'Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,' she said.
said Hagrid.
'I can't,' said Hagrid.
'Hagrid,' said Harry loudly, 'give it a fortnight and Norbert's 

going to be as long as your house.
Harry suddenly turned to Ron.
'Charlie,' he said.
'You're losing it, too,' said Ron.
said Ron.
said Harry, hurrying to let her in.
'We've got the Invisibility Cloak,' said Harry.
Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.
'It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday,' said Hermione, but 

this didn't soothe Ron at all.
he said in a hoarse voice.
'Harry!'
'I think I've got a good idea of what's been going on,' said 
Professor McGonagall.
'I'm disgusted,' said Professor McGonagall.
said Harry miserably.
said Ron.
So what do we do, Harry?'
said Harry.
'Abou' time,' he said.
All 
right, Harry, Hermione?'
said Hagrid, frowning at Filch.
'I'm not going in that Forest,' he said, and Harry was pleased to 

hear the note of panic in his voice.
Harry asked.
'Not fast enough,' said Hagrid.
'Oh, it's you, Ronan,' said Hagrid in relief.
'Good evening to you, Hagrid,' said Ronan.
'We'd noticed,' said Hermione faintly.
'Yeah,' said Hagrid, glancing up too.
'Hullo, Bane,' said Hagrid.
'We've heard,' said Hagrid grumpily.
said Harry.
said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.
'You are the Potter boy,' he said.
said Firenze.
'No,' said Harry, startled by the odd question.
Harry, are you all right?'
'I'm fine,' said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying.
'Good luck, Harry Potter,' said Firenze.
said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he 
thought Voldemort could hear them.
'I'm not ill,' said Harry.
When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, 'That's just the 
exams.
said Ron sleepily.
'I've just thought of something,' said Harry.
said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across 
the grounds towards the Forest, didn't answer.
'Yes, please,' said Ron, but Harry cut across him.
'Forget I said it!
'We've got to go to Dumbledore,' said Harry.
'We want to see Professor Dumbledore,' said Hermione, rather 

bravely, Harry and Ron thought.
said Harry frantically.
'Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,' she said finally.
'It's tonight,' said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall 

was out of earshot.
'You want to be more careful,' said Snape.
'It's obvious,' said Ron.
Harry and Ron went back to the common room.
Harry had just 
said, 'At least Hermione's on Snape's tail,' when the portrait of the 
Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.
Harry said.
said Ron.
said Hermione.
After what McGonagall and Snape 

have said?
'You're right, Harry,' said Hermione in a small voice.
'I'll use the Invisibility Cloak,' said Harry.
said Ron.
'Of course not,' said Hermione briskly.
'Not if I can help it,' said Hermione grimly.
Harry and Ron didn't talk much.
said a voice from the corner of the room.
'You're going out again,' he said.
'No, no, no,' said Hermione.
'You can't go out,' said Neville, 'you'll be caught again.
'You don't understand,' said Harry, 'this is important.'
said Neville.
'Yes, but not to us,' said Ron in exasperation.
Harry turned to Hermione.
'Do something,' he said desperately.
'We had to, Neville, no time to explain,' said Harry.
'Oh, let's kick her, just this once,' Ron whispered in Harry's ear, 
but Harry shook his head.
he said suddenly as they climbed towards him.
'Well, there you are,' Harry said quietly.
'If you want to go back, I won't blame you,' he said.
'Don't be stupid,' said Ron.
'We're coming,' said Hermione.
'Looks like a harp,' said Ron.
'It must wake up the moment you stop playing,' said Harry.
Hermione said anxiously.
said Ron.
Then he looked up at Ron and said, 'If anything 
happens to me, don't follow.
'Right,' said Ron.
'Lucky this plant thing's here, really,' said Ron.
said Hermione.
'Yeah,' said Ron, 'and lucky Harry doesn't lose his head in a crisis 
– "there's no wood", honestly.'
'This way,' said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway which 
was the only way on.
said Ron.
'Probably,' said Harry.
said Ron.
Harry said suddenly, 'they're keys!
said Ron.
said Hermione nervously.
'I think,' said Ron, 'we're going to have to be chessmen.'
Finally 

he said, 'Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are 
that good at chess –' 
 



 
 

'We're not offended,' said Harry quickly.
'I'm going to be a knight,' said Ron.
'Had to let that happen,' said Ron, looking shaken.
'Yes ...' said Ron softly, 'it's the only way ...
Harry and Hermione shouted.
'He'll be all right,' said Harry, trying to convince himself.
'Snape's,' said Harry.
'Brilliant,' said Hermione.
'Of course not,' said Hermione.
'Got it,' she said.
'There's only enough there for one of us,' he said.
'You drink that,' said Harry.
'But Harry – what if You-Know-Who's with him?'
said Harry, pointing at his 

scar.
'I'm not as good as you,' said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let 

go of him.
said Hermione.
'You drink first,' said Harry.
'Positive,' said Hermione.
said Harry anxiously.
Harry couldn't take it in.
said Quirrell impatiently.
'Get out of the way,' he said.
the face said.
Harry!'
'Good afternoon, Harry,' said Dumbledore.
said Harry blankly.
said Harry.
'No, Harry, he has not.
When he had found his voice again, Harry said, 'And the 
Invisibility Cloak – do you know who sent it to me?'
'Quirrell said Snape –' 
'Professor Snape, Harry.'
'Yes ...' said Dumbledore dreamily.
'Harry!'
'Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to – Dumbledore was 

so worried –' 
'The whole school's talking about it,' said Ron.
said Ron finally.
'That's what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that – what was 
it?
'I always said he was off his rocker,' said Ron, looking quite 
impressed at how mad his hero was.
said Harry.
'Well, I got back all right,' said Hermione.
He 
already knew – he just said, "Harry's gone after him, hasn't he?"
said Ron.
'No, it isn't,' said Harry thoughtfully.
'Oh good,' said Harry.
said Harry anxiously and at last 
Hagrid gave a weak chuckle.
Dumbledore said cheerfully.
'Ahem,' said Dumbledore.
'Third – to Mr Harry Potter ...' said Dumbledore.
It was a shame, but as Ron 
said, you couldn't have everything in life.
'Thanks,' said Harry.
'Still famous,' said Ron, grinning at him.
'Not where I'm going, I promise you,' said Harry.
'Harry Potter!'
she said.
'Very,' said Harry.
said Mrs Weasley.
Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.
'Oh, I will,' said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that 
was spreading over his face.
