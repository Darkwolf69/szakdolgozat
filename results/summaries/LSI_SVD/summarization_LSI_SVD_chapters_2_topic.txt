 CHAPTER ONE  

The Boy Who Lived 

Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to 
say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much.
Mr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat.
As Mr 
Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the 
cat in his mirror.
Mr 
Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his 
mind.
'The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard –' 
'– yes, their son, Harry –' 
Mr Dursley stopped dead.
said Mr Dursley loudly.
Was this normal 
cat behaviour, Mr Dursley wondered.
Mrs Dursley had had a nice, normal day.
Mr Dursley tried to 
act normally.
Mr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair.
snapped Mrs Dursley.
'I suppose so,' said Mrs Dursley stiffly.
'Oh, yes,' said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly.
While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr Dursley crept 
to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden.
Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly but 
Mr Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind.
'Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.'
'You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day,' said 

Professor McGonagall.
Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
'You can't blame them,' said Dumbledore gently.
'I know that,' said Professor McGonagall irritably.
'No, thank you,' said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though 
she didn't think this was the moment for sherbet lemons.
Professor McGonagall flinched, but 
Dumbledore, who was unsticking two sherbet lemons, seemed 
not to notice.
'I know you haven't,' said Professor McGonagall, sounding halfexasperated
, half-admiring.
Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and 

said, 'The owls are nothing to the rumours that are flying around.
Professor McGonagall gasped.
Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on.
faltered Professor McGonagall.
'We can only guess,' said Dumbledore.
'Yes,' said Professor McGonagall.
'Dumbledore – you can't.
Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, 
swallowed and then said, 'Yes – yes, you're right, of course.
'I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place,' said Professor 

McGonagall grudgingly, 'but you can't pretend he's not careless.
'Hagrid,' said Dumbledore, sounding relieved.
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the 
bundle of blankets.
whispered Professor McGonagall.
'Yes,' said Dumbledore.
hissed Professor McGonagall.
'Well,' said Dumbledore finally, 'that's that.
G'night, Professor McGonagall – Professor 
Dumbledore, sir.'
'I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,' said 
Dumbledore, nodding to her.

'Nearly,' said Harry.
Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, 
as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise – unless of course it 
involved punching somebody.
He 
looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he 
had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's and Dudley was about 
four times bigger than he was.
Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over 
the bacon.
About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his 

newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut.
Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon.
Aunt 
Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel – Harry 
often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.
Dudley, meanwhile, was 
counting his presents.
Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began 
wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned 
the table over.
Dudley thought for a moment.
Uncle Vernon chuckled.
Atta 

boy, Dudley!'
He ruffled Dudley's hair.
'Bad news, Vernon,' she said.
said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as 
though he'd planned this.
'I won't blow up the house,' said Harry, but they weren't listening.
'I suppose we could take him to the zoo,' said Aunt Petunia 

slowly, '... and leave him in the car ...' 
'That car's new, he's not sitting in it alone ...' 
Dudley began to cry loudly.
said Aunt Petunia frantically – and a moment later, Dudley's best 
friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother.
Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.
Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was 
sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on 
the way to the zoo for the first time in his life.
His aunt and uncle 
hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but 
before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.
'I'm not going to do anything,' said Harry, 'honestly ...' 
But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him.
While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia.
'I had a dream about a motorbike,' said Harry, remembering 
suddenly.
Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front.
Dudley and Piers sniggered.
'I know they don't,' said Harry.
Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous 
cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons.
'Do it again,' Dudley ordered.
'This is boring,' Dudley moaned.
The snake jerked its head towards Uncle Vernon and Dudley, 
then raised its eyes to the ceiling.
It gave Harry a look that said 
quite plainly: 'I get that all the time.'
'DUDLEY!
Dudley came waddling towards them as fast as he could.
'Out of the way, you,' he said, punching Harry in the ribs.
Piers and 
Dudley could only gibber.
As far as Harry had seen, the snake 
hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it 
passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, 
Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while 
Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death.
But worst 
of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, 
'Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?'
Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house 
before starting on Harry.
Everybody knew that Dudley's 
gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and 
broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.

Dudley had a place at 
Uncle Vernon's old school, Smeltings.
'No thanks,' said Harry.
Then he ran, 
before Dudley could work out what he'd said.
As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle 
Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life.
'Your new school uniform,' she said.
'Oh,' he said.
Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses 
because of the smell from Harry's new uniform.
'Get the post, Dudley,' said Uncle Vernon from behind his 
paper.
'Make Harry get it.'
'Get the post, Harry.'
shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen.
said Dudley suddenly.
said Harry, trying to snatch it back.
sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the 

letter open with one hand and glancing at it.
Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held 

it high out of his reach.
'Vernon!
'I want to read that letter,' he said loudly.
'I want to read it,' said Harry furiously, 'as it's mine.'
'Get out, both of you,' croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter 

back inside its envelope.
roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and 

Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, 
slamming the kitchen door behind them.
'But what should we do, Vernon?
'No,' he said finally.
That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did 
something he'd never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.
said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had 
squeezed through the door.
It was addressed to you by mistake,' said Uncle 
Vernon shortly.
'It was not a mistake,' said Harry angrily.
said Harry.
The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon 

and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, 
Marge), one where Dudley slept and one where Dudley kept all 
the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom.
Uncle Vernon 
and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.
When the post arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying 
to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it.
Uncle Vernon had to 
wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which 
was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle 
Vernon around the neck from behind.
Harry shuffled miserably 
off into the kitchen, and by the time he got back, the post 
had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap.
Uncle Vernon didn't go to work that day.
Uncle Vernon stayed at home again.
When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with 
their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut.
Aunt Petunia suggested 
timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear 
her.
Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling.
he said.
'I've already got us some rations,' said Uncle Vernon, 'so all 
aboard!'
he said cheerfully

he said stupidly.
'An' here's Harry!'
said the giant.
'Las' time I saw you, you was only a baby,' said the giant.
he said.
'Anyway – Harry,' said the giant, turning his back on the 
Dursleys, 'a very happy birthday to yeh.
Harry looked up at the giant.
Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything
, he said, 'I'm sorry, but I still don't really know who you are.'
'Call me Hagrid,' he said, 'everyone does.
'Er – no,' said Harry.
'Sorry,' Harry said quickly.
asked Harry.
'I know some things,' he said.
But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, 'About our world, I 

mean.
Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.
he said finally.
said Harry eagerly.
'Ah, go boilyourheads, both of yeh,' said Hagrid.
'Harry –youra 

wizard.'
gasped Harry.
With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled 
a note which Harry could read upside-down: 

 
Dear Mr Dumbledore, 

Given Harry his letter.
'He's not going,' he said.
'I'd liketosee a great Muggle like you stop him,' he said.
said Harry, interested.
'A Muggle,' said Hagrid.
said Harry.
Harry had gone very white.
Harry asked urgently.
Harry suggested.
Dark days, Harry.
'Sorry,' he said.
'Good question, Harry.
Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his 
eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite 
sure there had been a horrible mistake.
'Hagrid,' he said quietly, 'I think you must have made a mistake.
Harry looked into the fire.
Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was 
positively beaming at him.
said Hagrid.
'Harry Potter, not a wizard – you wait, you'll 
be right famous at Hogwarts.'
asked Harry.
'You can kip under that,' he said.

'Hagrid!'
said Harry loudly.
said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.
Harry asked, looking around for 
another boat.
'Flew,' said Hagrid.
Harry asked.
Harry asked, before he could stop 
himself. 

'
'Course,' said Hagrid.
'Well, so they say,' said Hagrid.
'Good,' said Hagrid.
'Ifyouknow where to go,' said Hagrid.
'Harry Potter ... 
what an honour.'
Harry didn't know what to say.
said Hagrid.
Come on, Harry.'
Hagrid grinned at Harry.
'Right, stand back, Harry.'
'Welcome,' said Hagrid, 'to Diagon Alley.'
'Like I said, yeh'd be madtotry an' rob it,' said Hagrid.
'Morning,' said Hagrid to a free goblin.
Harry asked.
'Can't tellyouthat,' said Hagrid mysteriously.
'Stalagmite's got an "m" in it,' said Hagrid.
Harry asked.
'Yes,' said Harry.
'No,' said Harry.
'That's Hagrid,' said Harry, pleased to know something the boy 
didn't.
'He's the gamekeeper,' said Harry.
said Hagrid.
When they had left the shop, he 
said, 'Hagrid, what's Quidditch?'
'Don' mention it,' said Hagrid gruffly.
Harry Potter.'
'It was, sir, yes,' said Hagrid.
'Oh, no, sir,' said Hagrid quickly.
'Er – well, I'm right-handed,' said Harry.
Harry tried.
Harry took the wand.
'You all right, Harry?
Yer very quiet,' said Hagrid.
'Don' you worry, Harry.

Ron's new, too.'
'Yes,' said Harry.
she said kindly, and Harry 
nodded.
'Er – OK,' said Harry.
said Harry.
'Oh, him,' said Harry.
'Shut up,' said Ron.
said their mother.
And look after Ron.'
'Shut up,' said Ron again.
'Harry Potter!'
'Harry,' said the other twin, 'did we introduce ourselves?
'Bye,' said Harry and Ron.
'Are you really Harry Potter?'
Ron 

stared.
'Yes,' said Harry, 'but I can't remember it.'
said Ron eagerly.
'Wow,' said Ron.
'Er – yes, I think so,' said Ron.
'Five,' said Ron.
said Harry.
'Go 
on –' 

'You don't want this, it's all dry,' said Ron.
'No,' said Ron.
said Harry.
said Ron.
said Ron.
'Help yourself,' said Harry.
'He'll turn up,' said Harry.
'Don't know why he's so bothered,' said Ron.
'I'm Ron Weasley,' Ron muttered.
'Harry Potter,' said Harry.
'Gryffindor,' said Ron.
'Yeah,' said Ron.
Ron asked.
he said.
'Yes,' said Harry.
He turned back to Harry.
'I think he's been knocked out,' Ron said to Harry.
'I've heard of his family,' said Ron darkly.
All right there, Harry?'

'The firs'-years, Professor McGonagall,' said Hagrid.
'Welcome to Hogwarts,' said Professor McGonagall.
'I shall return when we are ready for you,' said Professor 
McGonagall.
said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them.
said the Friar.
'Move along now,' said a sharp voice.
Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall 
silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first-years.
Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought 
wildly, that seemed the sort of thing – noticing that everyone in 
 



 
 
the Hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it too.
'So we've just got to try on the hat!'
Ron whispered to Harry.
'When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the 
stool to be sorted,' she said.
shouted the hat.
Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at 
once, but at others it took a little while to decide.
'Finnigan, 
Seamus', the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the 
stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a 
Gryffindor.
shouted the hat.
What 
if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until 
Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had 
obviously been a mistake and he'd better get back on the train?
'The Harry Potter?'
The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes 

was the Hall full of people craning to get a good look at him.
'Hmm,' said a small voice in his ear.
said the small voice.
Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole Hall.
Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a 
second later the hat had shouted, 'GRYFFINDOR!'
'Well done, Ron, excellent,' said Percy Weasley pompously 
across Harry as 'Zabini, Blaise' was made a Slytherin.
Professor 
McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.
he said.
said Percy airily.
Potatoes, Harry?'
'I haven't eaten for nearly five hundred years,' said the ghost.
said Ron suddenly.
'Like this,' he said irritably.
'I've never asked,' said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.
said Ron.
Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore.
Harder to shake 

off was the feeling Harry had got from the teacher's look – a feeling 
that he didn't like Harry at all.
'Must be,' said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore.
'Everyone pick their favourite tune,' said Dumbledore, 'and off 
we go!'
'Ah, music,' he said, wiping his eyes.
he said, with an evil cackle.
'You want to watch out for Peeves,' said Percy, as they set off 
again.
she said.

'Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous 
magic you will learn at Hogwarts,' she said.
Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron.
Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar 
on his porridge.
'Double Potions with the Slytherins,' said Ron.
'Wish McGonagall favoured us,' said Harry.
Dear Harry, (it said, in a very untidy scrawl) 

I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to 
come and have a cup of tea with me around three?
Hagrid 
 

Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled 'Yes, please, see you later' on 
the back of the note and sent Hedwig off again.
It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, 
because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that 
had happened to him so far.
Snape didn't dislike Harry – he 
hated him.
'Ah, yes,' he said softly, 'Harry Potter.
His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had 
none of Hagrid's warmth.
said Snape suddenly.
'I don't know, sir,' said Harry.
'I don't know, sir.'
'I don't know,' said Harry quietly.
Over 
the noise, Snape said, 'And a point will be taken from Gryffindor 
house for your cheek, Potter.'
'Cheer up,' said Ron.
Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?'
Then Hagrid's voice rang out, 
saying, 'Back, Fang – back.'
'Hang on,' he said.
'Make yerselves at home,' said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who 
bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears.
Like Hagrid, 
Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.
'This is Ron,' Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water 
into a large teapot and putting rock cakes on to a plate.
said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles.
The rock cakes almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron 
pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their 
first lessons.
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch 'that old 
git'.
Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson.
Hagrid, like Ron, told 
Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the 
students.
said Hagrid.
Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet 

his eyes when he said that.
Hagrid asked Ron.
Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose.
While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, 
Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under 
the tea cosy.
'But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your 
noses out if you know what's good for you,' said a Gringotts 
spokesgoblin this afternoon.
'Hagrid!'
said Harry.
There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet 
Harry's eyes this time.
As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their 
pockets weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to 
refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had 
given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid.
Had Hagrid 
collected that package just in time?
And did 
Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn't want to tell 
Harry?

'Typical,' said Harry darkly.
'You don't know you'll make a fool of yourself,' said Ron reasonably
.
Harry and Ron jumped to their feet.
'What's going on?'
Harry and Ron were delighted when she 
told Malfoy he'd been doing it wrong for years.
'Give that here, Malfoy,' said Harry quietly.
'HARRY POTTER!'
thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was 
going to use on him?
'Follow me, you two,' said Professor McGonagall, and they 
marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.
'He's just the build for a Seeker, too,' said Wood, now walking 

around Harry and staring at him.
he said.
'Wood 
told me.'
'I start training next week,' said Harry.
'Wood told us.
You must be good, Harry, Wood was 
almost skipping when he told us.'
'I'd take you on any time on my own,' said Malfoy.
'Of course he has,' said Ron, wheeling round.
'Crabbe,' he said.
When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.
said Harry.
said Ron.
'And it's really none of your business,' said Harry.
'Goodbye,' said Ron.
said Ron furiously.
'Come on,' he said to Ron.
'Now what am I going to do?'
'That's your problem,' said Ron.
'I'm coming with you,' she said.
'You've got some nerve –' said Ron loudly.
said Harry sharply.
said Harry.
'Fine,' said Neville, showing them.
said Neville, scrambling to his feet.
'We've got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,' said Ron, 'quickly 
as possible.'
'Malfoy tricked you,' Hermione said to Harry.
He was never going to meet you – Filch knew someone 
was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him 
off.'
Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn't going to 
tell her that.
It was a while before any of them said anything.
said Ron finally.
'No, we don't mind,' he said.

'Or both,' said Harry.
Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she 
was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added 
bonus.
Ron grinned at Harry.
'Yes, yes, that's right,' said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.
Hermione was 
stomping up the stairs looking disapprovingly at the package in 
Harry's hand.
said Harry.
'Yes, don't stop now,' said Ron, 'it's doing us so much good.'
Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.
'Very nice,' said Wood, his eyes glinting.
'Right,' said Wood.
'This ball's called the Quaffle,' said Wood.
said Wood curiously.
'Never mind,' said Harry quickly.
'Three Chasers, one Keeper,' said Harry, who was determined to 
remember it all.
'I'll show you now,' said Wood.
'I'm going to show you what the Bludgers do,' Wood said.
'Very good,' said Wood.
'This,' said Wood, 'is the Golden Snitch, and it's the most 
important ball of the lot.
Ron, however, was to be 
working with Hermione Granger.
It was hard to tell whether Ron 
or Hermione was angrier about this.
'You're saying it wrong,' Harry heard Hermione snap.
It was 
Hermione.
said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable.
'I've just thought – Hermione.'
'He's heading for the third floor,' Harry said, but Ron held up 

his hand.
'Good idea,' said Ron nervously.
'Hermione!'
they said together.
Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, 
looking as if she was about to faint.
The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione.
It was Hermione who spoke first.
'I don't think so,' said Harry.
Professor McGonagall was looking at 
Ron and Harry.
Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.
Hermione Granger, telling a downright 

lie to a teacher?
Hermione hung her head.
Hermione left.
Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.
'Five, you mean, once she's taken off Hermione's.'
But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their 
friend.

Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping.
Harry showed him.
'Dunno, but I hope it's really hurting him,' said Ron bitterly.
Harry, 
Ron and Hermione sat together next to a window.
Hermione was 
checking Harry and Ron's Charms homework for them.
Harry felt restless.
'Rather you than me,' they said together, but Harry had an idea 
that Snape wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening.
Harry gulped.
Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from 

Gryffindor.
Ron asked as Harry joined them.
'No – he wouldn't,' she said.
'I'm with Harry.
Harry felt terrible.
'Harry, you need your strength,' said Seamus Finnigan.
'OK, men,' he said.
'And women,' said Chaser Angelina Johnson.
'The big one,' said Fred Weasley.
'The one we've all been waiting for,' said George.
'Shut up, you two,' said Wood.
'Hagrid!'
'Nope,' said Ron.
'Harry hasn't had much to do yet.'
'All right there, Harry?'
Harry saw it.
A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below – 
Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose and Harry's broom 
span off course, Harry holding on for dear life.
Harry's 
broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it.
'Can't have,' Hagrid said, his voice shaking.
'He's doing something – jinxing the broom,' said Hermione.
Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry.
Ron said.
'Rubbish,' said Hagrid, who hadn't heard a word of what had 
gone on next to him in the stands.
Harry, Ron and Hermione looked at each other, wondering 
what to tell him.
he said.
said Harry eagerly.
'Now, don't ask me any more,' said Hagrid gruffly.
'Rubbish,' said Hagrid again.
'So why did he just try and kill Harry?'
said Hagrid hotly.
'I don' know why 
 



 
 
Harry's broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn' try an' kill a student
!
said Harry.

'I'll get him,' said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy's back, 'one 
of these days, I'll get him –' 

'I hate them both,' said Harry, 'Malfoy and Snape.'
'Just one,' said Hermione.
'We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all,' said 
Hermione.
'Nothing,' said Harry.
said 
Hermione.
'And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,' 
said Ron.
'Very safe, as they're both dentists,' said Hermione.
'You too,' said Harry.
'Will you look at this?
said Ron, turning to his own 
pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry's.
'That's friendly,' said Harry.
he said.
'You can keep it,' said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was.
'It's an Invisibility Cloak,' said Ron, a look of awe on his face.
Look down!'
said Ron suddenly.
'I'd give anything for one of these,' he said.
'Nothing,' said Harry.
'Hey, look – Harry's got a Weasley jumper, too!'
Harry said nothing.
His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and 
Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself 
but see no reflection again.
* 
'You could have woken me up,' said Ron, crossly.
'I'd like to see your mum and dad,' Ron said eagerly.
'You can see them any old time,' said Ron.
said Ron.
'You look odd.'
'I'm freezing,' said Ron.
'See?'
'Look!
Look at them all ... there are loads of them ...' 

 



 
 

'I can only see you.'
Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he 

couldn't see his family any more, just Ron in his paisley pyjamas.
'Look at me!'
he said.
And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.
said Ron.
So what if they can't see you?
But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get 

back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him.
The happiest man on earth would be able to 

use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would 
look into it and see himself exactly as he is.
Then he said slowly, 'It shows us what we want 
... whatever we want ...' 

'Yes and no,' said Dumbledore quietly.
'What do you see when you look in the Mirror?'

'You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you 
mad,' said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.
'Don't talk to me for a moment,' said Ron when Harry sat down 
next to him.
'Don't play,' said Hermione at once.
'Say you're ill,' said Ron.
'Really break your leg,' said Ron.
'I can't,' said Harry.
Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit 
with Harry and Ron.
'Malfoy,' said Neville shakily.
said Ron.
'You're worth twelve of Malfoy,' Harry said.
'Thanks, Harry ...
'Dumbledore again,' he said.
Then he looked 

up at Ron and Hermione.
said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she'd 
looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the 
pages, muttering to herself.
said Ron grumpily.
said Harry and Ron.
said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished.
said Harry.
It wasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch 
team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.
I'm going to play,' he told Ron and Hermione.
'I know,' Ron snapped.
Harry's heart did a somersault.
Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still 

not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, 'You tell him, 
Neville.'
'I'm warning you, Malfoy – one more word –' 
'Ron!'
said Hermione suddenly.
'Harry –!'
said Malfoy.
Ron snapped.
'Come on, Harry!'
'Ron!
Ron!
Harry's won!
'Well done,' said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could 
hear.
Harry had reached the shed.
Harry leant forward.
* 
'Harry where have you been?'
shouted Ron, thumping Harry on 
the back.
'Never mind that now,' said Harry breathlessly.
said Hermione in alarm.
'It'll be gone by next Tuesday,' said Ron.

said Hagrid again.
They'll think 
I've toldyou–' 

'See you later, then,' said Harry.
Hagrid shuffled off.
said Hermione thoughtfully
.
'But it's against our laws,' said Ron.
said Harry.
'Of course there are,' said Ron.
'So what on earth's Hagrid up to?'
said Hermione.
Hagrid called, 'Who is it?'
'Yes,' said Harry.
Hagrid frowned at him.
'O' course I can't,' he said.
Harry and Ron 
beamed at Hermione.
Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he 

was.
said Harry anxiously.
'Hagrid, 
can we have a window open?
'Can't, Harry, sorry,' said Hagrid.
'Hagrid – what's that?'
'Ah,' said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard.
'That's – er ...' 
'Where did you get it, Hagrid?'
'Won it,' said Hagrid.
said 
Hermione.
'Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,' she said.
But Hagrid wasn't listening.
Hermione had now started making revision 
timetables for Harry and Ron, too.
Hagrid murmured.
said Hagrid.
'Hagrid,' said Hermione, 'how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks 

grow, exactly?'
'I can't,' said Hagrid.
'Hagrid,' said Harry loudly, 'give it a fortnight and Norbert's 

going to be as long as your house.
Hagrid bit his lip.
'Charlie,' he said.
'You're losing it, too,' said Ron.
said Ron.
'How about it, Hagrid?'
said Harry, hurrying to let her in.
'We've got the Invisibility Cloak,' said Harry.
Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.
'It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday,' said Hermione, but 

this didn't soothe Ron at all.

'Harry!'
said Harry miserably.
Harry told them what he'd heard.
said Ron.
So what do we do, Harry?'
said Harry.
All 
right, Harry, Hermione?'
'I shouldn't be too friendly to them, Hagrid,' said Filch coldly, 
'they're here to be punished, after all.'
said Hagrid, frowning at Filch.
'Yeh are ifyouwanttostay at Hogwarts,' said Hagrid fiercely.
'Look there,' said Hagrid, 'see that stuff shinin' on the ground?
'There's nothin' that lives in the Forest that'll hurtyouifyour
with me or Fang,' said Hagrid.
'All right, but I warn yeh, he's a coward,' said Hagrid.
Harry asked.
'Not fast enough,' said Hagrid.
'You all right, Hermione?'
Harry suggested.
'That wasn' no werewolf an' it wasn' no unicorn, neither,' said 

Hagrid grimly.
Harry and 
Hermione's jaws dropped.
'Oh, it's you, Ronan,' said Hagrid in relief.
'Good evening to you, Hagrid,' said Ronan.
'Can't be too careful, Ronan,' said Hagrid, patting his crossbow.
This is Harry Potter an' 
Hermione Granger, by the way.
'Good evening,' said Ronan.
'Yeah,' said Hagrid, glancing up too.
'Yeah,' said Hagrid, 'but haveyouseen anythin', Ronan?
'Hullo, Bane,' said Hagrid.
'All right?'
'We've heard,' said Hagrid grumpily.
'Never,' said Hagrid irritably, 'try an' get a straight answer out of 
a centaur.
said Harry.
'Hagrid!
Right, we're changin' groups – Neville, you stay with 
me an' Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an' this idiot.
'Are you all right?'
said Firenze.
'Do you mean,' Harry croaked, 'that was Vol–' 
'Harry!
Harry, are you all right?'
'Good luck, Harry Potter,' said Firenze.
Harry couldn't sit down.
Harry wasn't listening.

said Ron sleepily.
'But what can we –' 
Hermione gasped.
Hermione, you'd better do that.'
'It's obvious,' said Ron.
Harry said.
said Ron.
said Hermione.
'You're right, Harry,' said Hermione in a small voice.
said Ron.
'Of course not,' said Hermione briskly.
'Not if I can help it,' said Hermione grimly.
'No, no, no,' said Hermione.
said Neville.
Harry turned to Hermione.
whispered Ron.
'Don't be stupid,' said Ron.
'We're coming,' said Hermione.
Hermione whispered.
Hermione said anxiously.
said Ron.
'Right,' said Ron.
Come on, Hermione!'
said Hermione.
Ron whispered.
said Ron.
said Ron.
'These birds ... they can't be here just for decoration,' said 

Hermione.
said Ron.
said Hermione nervously.
'I think,' said Ron, 'we're going to have to be chessmen.'
'I'm going to be a knight,' said Ron.
Harry and Hermione shouted.
'Snape's,' said Harry.
'Brilliant,' said Hermione.
'Of course not,' said Hermione.
'Got it,' she said.
'You drink that,' said Harry.
'Hermione!'
said Hermione.
'Positive,' said Hermione.

gasped Harry.
'I see the Stone ...
Harry 
gasped.
So 
if I look in the Mirror, I should see myself finding it – which 
means I'll see where it's hidden!
'Look in the Mirror and tell me 

 



 
 
what you see.'
'What do you see?'
What did you just see?'
the face said.
Quirrell was walking backwards at him, so that Voldemort 

could still see him.
shrieked Voldemort again and Quirrell 
lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of him, 
both hands around Harry's neck – Harry's scar was almost blinding 
him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.
Quirrell screamed and tried to throw 
Harry off – the pain in Harry's head was building – he couldn't see 
– he could only hear Quirrell's terrible shrieks and Voldemort's 
yells of 'KILL HIM!
Harry!'
'Good afternoon, Harry,' said Dumbledore.
The Stone!
It 

was Quirrell!
He's got the Stone!
'Quirrell does not have the Stone.'
'But sir, the Stone –' 
'I see you are not to be distracted.
Very well, the Stone.
said Harry blankly.
said Harry.
'No, Harry, he has not.
'Quirrell said Snape –' 
'Professor Snape, Harry.'
'How did I get the Stone out of the Mirror?'
'Harry!'
'Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to – Dumbledore was 

so worried –' 
'The whole school's talking about it,' said Ron.
Harry told 
them everything: Quirrell; the Mirror; the Stone and Voldemort.
'So the Stone's gone?'
said Harry.
He 
already knew – he just said, "Harry's gone after him, hasn't he?"
said Ron.
'No, it isn't,' said Harry thoughtfully.
'Oh good,' said Harry.
Let me see.
'Third – to Mr Harry Potter ...' said Dumbledore.
'Thanks,' said Harry.
'Not where I'm going, I promise you,' said Harry.
'Harry Potter!'
she said.
'Very,' said Harry.
