'We can only guess,' said Dumbledore.
'Yes,' said Professor McGonagall.
'I would trust Hagrid with my life,' said Dumbledore.
'Hagrid,' said Dumbledore, sounding relieved.
'Yes,' said Dumbledore.
'Well,' said Dumbledore finally, 'that's that.
'Yeah,' said Hagrid in a very muffled voice.
'Nearly,' said Harry.
He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the 
council, Harry, the bank and Harry were just a few of his favourite 
subjects.
'I know they don't,' said Harry.
Harry stared.
Harry asked.
But worst 
of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, 
'Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?'
At school, Harry had no one.
'No thanks,' said Harry.
'Oh,' he said.
'Make Harry get it.'
said Dudley suddenly.
said Harry, trying to snatch it back.
Harry didn't move.
'No,' he said finally.

himself.

'Well, so they say,' said Hagrid.
'Good,' said Hagrid.
'Ifyouknow where to go,' said Hagrid.
Harry didn't know what to say.
said Hagrid.
Come on, Harry.'
Hagrid grinned at Harry.
'Right, stand back, Harry.'
'Like I said, yeh'd be madtotry an' rob it,' said Hagrid.
'Morning,' said Hagrid to a free goblin.
Harry asked.
'Can't tellyouthat,' said Hagrid mysteriously.
'Stalagmite's got an "m" in it,' said Hagrid.
Harry asked.
she said, when Harry started to speak.
'Yes,' said Harry.
'No,' said Harry.
'That's Hagrid,' said Harry, pleased to know something the boy 
didn't.
'Oh,' said the boy, 'I've heard of him.
'He's the gamekeeper,' said Harry.
'They're dead,' said Harry shortly.
said Hagrid.
When they had left the shop, he 
said, 'Hagrid, what's Quidditch?'
'Don't make me feel worse,' said Harry.
'Don' mention it,' said Hagrid gruffly.
Harry jumped.
Harry Potter.'
'It was, sir, yes,' said Hagrid.
'Oh, no, sir,' said Hagrid quickly.
'Er – well, I'm right-handed,' said Harry.
Harry tried.
Harry swallowed.
'You all right, Harry?
Yer very quiet,' said Hagrid.
'Don' you worry, Harry.
Harry didn't say anything.
'I don't know,' said Harry, realising this for the first time.
Ron's new, too.'
'Yes,' said Harry.
she said kindly, and Harry 
nodded.
'Not to worry,' she said.
Go on, go now before Ron.'
'Er – OK,' said Harry.
he added to Harry.
said Harry.
'Oh, him,' said Harry.
'Ron, you've got something on your nose.'
said one of 

the twins.
'Shut up,' said Ron.
said their mother.
'You should have said something, we had no 
idea.'
said one of the 

twins.
And look after Ron.'
'Shut up,' said Ron again.
'Harry Potter!'
'Hey Ron.'
'Right,' mumbled Ron.
And this is Ron, our brother.
'Bye,' said Harry and Ron.
'Are you really Harry Potter?'
Ron blurted out.
Harry nodded.
Ron 

stared.
'Yes,' said Harry, 'but I can't remember it.'
said Ron eagerly.
'Wow,' said Ron.
asked Harry, who found Ron just 
as interesting as Ron found him.
'Er – yes, I think so,' said Ron.
'I heard you went to live with Muggles,' said Ron.
'Five,' said Ron.
This seemed to cheer Ron up.
said Harry.
'You said You-Know-Who's name!'
said Ron, sounding both 

shocked and impressed.
'Go 
on –' 

'You don't want this, it's all dry,' said Ron.
'No,' said Ron.
said Harry.
said Ron.
said Ron.
'Help yourself,' said Harry.
'He'll turn up,' said Harry.
'Don't know why he's so bothered,' said Ron.
said the girl.
She said all this very fast.
'I'm Ron Weasley,' Ron muttered.
'Harry Potter,' said Harry.
said Hermione.
said Harry, feeling dazed.
'Whatever house I'm in, I hope she's not in it,' said Ron.
asked Harry.
'Gryffindor,' said Ron.
'Yeah,' said Ron.
Harry stared.
Ron asked.
he said.
'Yes,' said Harry.
He turned back to Harry.
He held out his hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it.
Both Harry and Ron stood up.
'Say that again,' he said.
'I think he's been knocked out,' Ron said to Harry.
'I've heard of his family,' said Ron darkly.
Said they'd been bewitched.
Ron glared at her as she left.
All right there, Harry?'
Harry and Ron were 
followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione.
'The firs'-years, Professor McGonagall,' said Hagrid.
Harry swallowed.
he asked Ron.
said the Friar.
Ron whispered to Harry.
Ron groaned.
'The Harry Potter?'
said the small voice.
he said.
said Ron suddenly.
said Ron.
she said.
Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings
.
'Double Potions with the Slytherins,' said Ron.
'Ah, yes,' he said softly, 'Harry Potter.
said Snape suddenly.
'I don't know, sir,' said Harry.
'I don't know,' said Harry quietly.
'Cheer up,' said Ron.
'Hang on,' he said.
said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles.
said Hagrid.
'Hagrid!'
said Harry.
Harry and Ron jumped to their feet.
'Give that here, Malfoy,' said Harry quietly.
'HARRY POTTER!'
he said.
'Of course he has,' said Ron, wheeling round.
'Crabbe,' he said.
When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.
said Harry.
said Ron.
'Goodbye,' said Ron.
said Ron furiously.
'Come on,' he said to Ron.
'That's your problem,' said Ron.
'I'm coming with you,' she said.
'You've got some nerve –' said Ron loudly.
said Harry sharply.
said Harry.
Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione 

 



 
 
and Neville.
'Malfoy tricked you,' Hermione said to Harry.
It was a while before any of them said anything.
said Ron finally.
Harry suggested.
'No, we don't mind,' he said.
The dog was guarding something ... 
What had Hagrid said?
'Or both,' said Harry.
Ron couldn't resist it.
Ron grinned at Harry.
said Harry.
'Yes, don't stop now,' said Ron, 'it's doing us so much good.'
'Right,' said Wood.
'Never mind,' said Harry quickly.
'Very good,' said Wood.
Ron, however, was to be 
working with Hermione Granger.
said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable.
'Don't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid,' said Ron.
Harry whispered.
'He's heading for the third floor,' Harry said, but Ron held up 

his hand.
'Good idea,' said Ron nervously.
'Oh, no,' said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.
Harry gasped.
they said together.
Harry got to his feet.
'I don't think so,' said Harry.
Professor McGonagall was looking at 
Ron and Harry.
Harry looked at Ron, 
who was still standing with his wand in the air.
Harry looked at the 
floor.
Ron dropped his wand.
Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to 
them.
Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.
Harry showed him.
Harry, 
Ron and Hermione sat together next to a window.
Hermione was 
checking Harry and Ron's Charms homework for them.
Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was 
going to ask Snape if he could have it.
Ron asked as Harry joined them.
'No – he wouldn't,' she said.
'I'm with Harry.
'Hagrid!'
'Nope,' said Ron.
'All right there, Harry?'
Harry saw it.
'Can't have,' Hagrid said, his voice shaking.
Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared
.
Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry.
'Come on, Hermione,' Ron muttered desperately.
Ron said.
'It was Snape,' Ron was explaining.
Harry, Ron and Hermione looked at each other, wondering 
what to tell him.
he said.
said Harry eagerly.
'Now, don't ask me any more,' said Hagrid gruffly.
'Rubbish,' said Hagrid again.
said Hagrid hotly.
said Harry.
'I'll get him,' said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy's back, 'one 
of these days, I'll get him –' 

'I hate them both,' said Harry, 'Malfoy and Snape.'
'Just one,' said Hermione.
said Hagrid, following them out of the Hall.
Harry 
added.
'Nothing,' said Harry.
said 
Hermione.
'And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,' 
said Ron.
'You too,' said Harry.
said Ron, turning to his own 
pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry's.
'That's friendly,' said Harry.
he said.
'You can keep it,' said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was.
Ron gasped.
'It's an Invisibility Cloak,' said Ron, a look of awe on his face.
said Ron suddenly.
'Nothing,' said Harry.
'Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?'
Harry said nothing.
* 
'You could have woken me up,' said Ron, crossly.
'I'd like to see your mum and dad,' Ron said eagerly.
'You can see them any old time,' said Ron.
Harry couldn't eat.
said Ron.
'I'm freezing,' said Ron.
Harry whispered.
Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he 

couldn't see his family any more, just Ron in his paisley pyjamas.
he said.
And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.
said Ron.
But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get 

back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him.
Except – 
'So – back again, Harry?'
Harry thought.
Harry stood up.
Harry stared.
'You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you 
mad,' said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.
Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, 
something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.
'Don't talk to me for a moment,' said Ron when Harry sat down 
next to him.
'Don't play,' said Hermione at once.
'Say you're ill,' said Ron.
'Really break your leg,' said Ron.
'I can't,' said Harry.
Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit 
with Harry and Ron.
said Ron.
'You're worth twelve of Malfoy,' Harry said.
'Thanks, Harry ...
'Dumbledore again,' he said.
Then he looked 

up at Ron and Hermione.
said Ron grumpily.
said Harry and Ron.
said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished.
said Harry.
I'm going to play,' he told Ron and Hermione.
'I know,' Ron snapped.
said Hermione suddenly.
'Harry –!'
said Malfoy.
Ron snapped.
'Come on, Harry!'
'Ron!
Ron!
Harry's won!
* 
'Harry where have you been?'
shouted Ron, thumping Harry on 
the back.
'Never mind that now,' said Harry breathlessly.
said Hermione in alarm.
'It'll be gone by next Tuesday,' said Ron.
said Hagrid again.
said Hermione thoughtfully
.
'I'm going to see what section he was in,' said Ron, who'd had 

enough of working.
'But it's against our laws,' said Ron.
said Harry.
'Of course there are,' said Ron.
said Hermione.
'Yes,' said Harry.
'O' course I can't,' he said.
Harry and Ron 
beamed at Hermione.
Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he 

was.
said Harry anxiously.
'Can't, Harry, sorry,' said Hagrid.
Harry looked at it, too.
'Hagrid – what's that?'
'Won it,' said Hagrid.
said 
Hermione.
'Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,' she said.
Hermione had now started making revision 
timetables for Harry and Ron, too.
Harry whispered.
said Hagrid.
'I can't,' said Hagrid.
Harry suddenly turned to Ron.
'Charlie,' he said.
'You're losing it, too,' said Ron.
'I'm Ron, remember?'
said Ron.
'How about it, Hagrid?'
said Harry, hurrying to let her in.
Dear Ron, 

How are you?
'We've got the Invisibility Cloak,' said Harry.
Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.
'It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday,' said Hermione, but 

this didn't soothe Ron at all.
'Harry!'
Only Ron stood by him.
said Harry miserably.
Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing 
Ron on Astronomy.
Harry told them what he'd heard.
said Ron.
So what do we do, Harry?'
said Harry.
Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn't.
All 
right, Harry, Hermione?'
said Hagrid, frowning at Filch.
Harry asked.
'Not fast enough,' said Hagrid.
Harry suggested.
'Oh, it's you, Ronan,' said Hagrid in relief.
'Good evening to you, Hagrid,' said Ronan.
'Yeah,' said Hagrid, glancing up too.
'Hullo, Bane,' said Hagrid.
'We've heard,' said Hagrid grumpily.
said Harry.
'Hagrid!
'You are the Potter boy,' he said.
said Firenze.
'Do you mean,' Harry croaked, 'that was Vol–' 
'Harry!
Harry, are you all right?'
'Good luck, Harry Potter,' said Firenze.
Harry couldn't sit down.
Harry wasn't listening.
Ron hissed.
'I'm not ill,' said Harry.
said Ron sleepily.
'I've just thought of something,' said Harry.
'Yes, please,' said Ron, but Harry cut across him.
'Forget I said it!
'We've got to go to Dumbledore,' said Harry.
'We want to see Professor Dumbledore,' said Hermione, rather 

bravely, Harry and Ron thought.
Harry swallowed – now what?
said Harry frantically.
Harry and Ron wheeled round.
'It's obvious,' said Ron.
Harry and Ron went back to the common room.
'I'm sorry, Harry!'
Harry said.
said Ron.
said Hermione.
After what McGonagall and Snape 

have said?
Harry shouted.
'You're right, Harry,' said Hermione in a small voice.
'I'll use the Invisibility Cloak,' said Harry.
said Ron.
Harry and Ron didn't talk much.
'You're going out again,' he said.
'No, no, no,' said Hermione.
'You don't understand,' said Harry, 'this is important.'
said Neville.
'Yes, but not to us,' said Ron in exasperation.
Harry turned to Hermione.
Harry whispered.
'We had to, Neville, no time to explain,' said Harry.
'Oh, let's kick her, just this once,' Ron whispered in Harry's ear, 
but Harry shook his head.
whispered Ron.
'Well, there you are,' Harry said quietly.
'Don't be stupid,' said Ron.
'We're coming,' said Hermione.
'Looks like a harp,' said Ron.
Hermione said anxiously.
said Ron.
Then he looked up at Ron and said, 'If anything 
happens to me, don't follow.
'Right,' said Ron.
'Lucky this plant thing's here, really,' said Ron.
said Hermione.
Ron bellowed.
Ron whispered.
said Ron.
'Probably,' said Harry.
said Ron.
Harry said suddenly, 'they're keys!
Harry whispered.
said Ron.
said Hermione nervously.
'I think,' said Ron, 'we're going to have to be chessmen.'
Ron turned to the other two.
'I'm going to be a knight,' said Ron.
'Had to let that happen,' said Ron, looking shaken.
Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and 
Hermione were in danger.
'Yes ...' said Ron softly, 'it's the only way ...
Harry and Hermione shouted.
snapped Ron.
With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and 
Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway.
'He'll be all right,' said Harry, trying to convince himself.
Harry whispered.
'Snape's,' said Harry.
'Brilliant,' said Hermione.
'Of course not,' said Hermione.
'Got it,' she said.
'You drink that,' said Harry.
'But Harry – what if You-Know-Who's with him?'
said Harry, pointing at his 

scar.
said Hermione.
'You drink first,' said Harry.
'Positive,' said Hermione.
said Harry anxiously.
gasped Harry.
Harry couldn't take it in.
Harry 
gasped.
'Get out of the way,' he said.
'Harry Potter ...' it whispered.
the face said.
and other voices, maybe in 
Harry's own head, crying, 'Harry!
Harry!'
'Good afternoon, Harry,' said Dumbledore.
Harry stared at him.
said Harry blankly.
said Harry.
'No, Harry, he has not.
'Quirrell said Snape –' 
'Professor Snape, Harry.'
And she let Ron and Hermione in.
'Harry!'
'Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to – Dumbledore was 

so worried –' 
'The whole school's talking about it,' said Ron.
said Ron finally.
'That's what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that – what was 
it?
'I always said he was off his rocker,' said Ron, looking quite 
impressed at how mad his hero was.
said Harry.
'Well, I got back all right,' said Hermione.
He 
already knew – he just said, "Harry's gone after him, hasn't he?"
said Ron.
'No, it isn't,' said Harry thoughtfully.
'Oh good,' said Harry.
'Hagrid!'
'Third – to Mr Harry Potter ...' said Dumbledore.
This didn't worry 
Harry.
It was a shame, but as Ron 
said, you couldn't have everything in life.
'Thanks,' said Harry.
'Still famous,' said Ron, grinning at him.
'Not where I'm going, I promise you,' said Harry.
He, Ron and Hermione passed through the gateway together.
It was Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, but she wasn't 

pointing at Ron.
'Harry Potter!'
she said.
'Very,' said Harry.
said Mrs Weasley.
Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.
