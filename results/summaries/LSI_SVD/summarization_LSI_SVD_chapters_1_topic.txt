said Mr Dursley loudly.
'I suppose so,' said Mrs Dursley stiffly.
'Oh, yes,' said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly.
'Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.'
'You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day,' said 

Professor McGonagall.
Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
'You can't blame them,' said Dumbledore gently.
'I know that,' said Professor McGonagall irritably.
'It certainly seems so,' said Dumbledore.
'No, thank you,' said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though 
she didn't think this was the moment for sherbet lemons.
Professor McGonagall flinched, but 
Dumbledore, who was unsticking two sherbet lemons, seemed 
not to notice.
'I know you haven't,' said Professor McGonagall, sounding halfexasperated
, half-admiring.
'You flatter me,' said Dumbledore calmly.
Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and 

said, 'The owls are nothing to the rumours that are flying around.
Professor McGonagall gasped.
I know ...' he said heavily.
Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on.
faltered Professor McGonagall.
'We can only guess,' said Dumbledore.
It must have 
made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his 
pocket and said, 'Hagrid's late.
'Yes,' said Professor McGonagall.
'Dumbledore – you can't.
'It's the best place for him,' said Dumbledore firmly.
repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back 
down on the wall.
Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, 
swallowed and then said, 'Yes – yes, you're right, of course.
'I would trust Hagrid with my life,' said Dumbledore.
'I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place,' said Professor 

McGonagall grudgingly, 'but you can't pretend he's not careless.
'Hagrid,' said Dumbledore, sounding relieved.
'Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,' said the giant, climbing 
carefully off the motorbike as he spoke.
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the 
bundle of blankets.
whispered Professor McGonagall.
'Yes,' said Dumbledore.
'Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?'
hissed Professor McGonagall.
'But I c-c-can't stand it – Lily an' 
James dead – an' poor little Harry offtolive with Muggles –' 

'Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or 
we'll be found,' Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid 
gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden 
wall and walked to the front door.
For a full minute 
the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid's 
shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously and the 
twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed 
to have gone out.
'Well,' said Dumbledore finally, 'that's that.
G'night, Professor McGonagall – Professor 
Dumbledore, sir.'
'I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,' said 
Dumbledore, nodding to her.
Professor McGonagall blew her nose 
in reply.

'Nearly,' said Harry.
Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, 
as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise – unless of course it 
involved punching somebody.
Dudley's favourite punch-bag was 
Harry, but he couldn't often catch him.
Harry didn't look it, but he 
was very fast.
Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over 
the bacon.
About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his 

newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut.
Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen 
with his mother.
Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon.
Aunt 
Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel – Harry 
often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.
'All right, thirty-seven then,' said Dudley, going red in the face.
Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began 
wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned 
the table over.
Uncle Vernon chuckled.
At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to 

answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap 
the racing bike, a cine-camera, a remote-control aeroplane, sixteen 
new computer games and a video recorder.
'Bad news, Vernon,' she said.
Harry hated it there.
said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as 
though he'd planned this.
'I won't blow up the house,' said Harry, but they weren't listening.
'I suppose we could take him to the zoo,' said Aunt Petunia 

slowly, '... and leave him in the car ...' 
'That car's new, he's not sitting in it alone ...' 
Dudley began to cry loudly.
said Aunt Petunia frantically – and a moment later, Dudley's best 
friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother.
Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was 
sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on 
the way to the zoo for the first time in his life.
His aunt and uncle 
hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but 
before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.
'I'm not going to do anything,' said Harry, 'honestly ...' 
But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him.
While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia.
He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the 
council, Harry, the bank and Harry were just a few of his favourite 
subjects.
'I had a dream about a motorbike,' said Harry, remembering 
suddenly.
Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front.
Dudley and Piers sniggered.
'I know they don't,' said Harry.
They ate in the zoo restaurant and when Dudley had a 
tantrum because his knickerbocker glory wasn't big enough, 
 



 
 
Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to 
finish the first.
Uncle Vernon tapped 
on the glass, but the snake didn't budge.
The snake jerked its head towards Uncle Vernon and Dudley, 
then raised its eyes to the ceiling.
It gave Harry a look that said 
quite plainly: 'I get that all the time.'
'I know,' Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't 
sure the snake could hear him.
'DUDLEY!
'Out of the way, you,' he said, punching Harry in the ribs.
Piers and 
Dudley could only gibber.
As far as Harry had seen, the snake 
hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it 
passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, 
Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while 
Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death.
But worst 
of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, 
'Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?'
Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house 
before starting on Harry.
At school, Harry had no one.

Dudley had a place at 
Uncle Vernon's old school, Smeltings.
'No thanks,' said Harry.
Then he ran, 
before Dudley could work out what he'd said.
As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle 
Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life.
Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses 
because of the smell from Harry's new uniform.
'Get the post, Dudley,' said Uncle Vernon from behind his 
paper.
'Get the post, Harry.'
shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen.
said Dudley suddenly.
Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written 
on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was 
jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.
said Harry, trying to snatch it back.
sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the 

letter open with one hand and glancing at it.
Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held 

it high out of his reach.
'Vernon!
'Get out, both of you,' croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter 

back inside its envelope.
roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and 

Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, 
slamming the kitchen door behind them.
'But what should we do, Vernon?
Tell 
them we don't want –' 

Harry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up 
and down the kitchen.
That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did 
something he'd never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.
said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had 
squeezed through the door.
It was addressed to you by mistake,' said Uncle 
Vernon shortly.
'It was not a mistake,' said Harry angrily.
said Harry.
The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon 

and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, 
Marge), one where Dudley slept and one where Dudley kept all 
the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom.
Uncle Vernon 
and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.
When the post arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying 
to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it.
Uncle Vernon had to 
wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which 
was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle 
Vernon around the neck from behind.
Harry shuffled miserably 
off into the kitchen, and by the time he got back, the post 
had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap.
Uncle Vernon didn't go to work that day.
'Oh, these people's minds work in strange ways, Petunia, 

they're not like you and me,' said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock 
in a nail with the piece of fruit cake Aunt Petunia had just 
brought him.
Uncle Vernon stayed at home again.
Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him 

into the hall.
When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with 
their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut.
'That does it,' said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but 
pulling great tufts out of his moustache at the same time.
She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address: 
 

Mr H. Potter 
Room 17 
Railview Hotel 
Cokeworth 

 
Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his 
hand out of the way.
'I'll take them,' said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and 
following her from the dining-room.
Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling.
he said.
said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping 
his hands together.
'I've already got us some rations,' said Uncle Vernon, 'so all 
aboard!'

he said stupidly.
'An' here's Harry!'
said the giant.
'Las' time I saw you, you was only a baby,' said the giant.
he said.
'Ah, shut up, Dursley,yougreat prune,' said the giant.
'Anyway – Harry,' said the giant, turning his back on the 
Dursleys, 'a very happy birthday to yeh.
Harry looked up at the giant.
he said, rubbing his hands 

together.
Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything
, he said, 'I'm sorry, but I still don't really know who you are.'
'Call me Hagrid,' he said, 'everyone does.
'Er – no,' said Harry.
'Sorry,' Harry said quickly.
asked Harry.
'I know some things,' he said.
But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, 'About our world, I 

mean.
Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.
'Butyoumust know aboutyourmum and dad,' he said.
he said finally.
said Harry eagerly.
'Ah, go boilyourheads, both of yeh,' said Hagrid.
'Harry –youra 

wizard.'
gasped Harry.
said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, 

still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.
'He's not going,' he said.
'I'd liketosee a great Muggle like you stop him,' he said.
said Harry, interested.
'A Muggle,' said Hagrid.
said Harry.
Harry asked urgently.
Harry suggested.
'Sorry,' he said.
Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his 
eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite 
sure there had been a horrible mistake.
'Hagrid,' he said quietly, 'I think you must have made a mistake.
Harry looked into the fire.
Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was 
positively beaming at him.
said Hagrid.
asked Harry.
'It's gettin' late and we've got lotstodo tomorrow,' said Hagrid 

loudly.
'You can kip under that,' he said.

'Hagrid!'
said Harry loudly.
said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.
'Don't worry about that,' said Hagrid, standing up and scratching 
his head.
Harry followed Hagrid out on to the rock.
'Flew,' said Hagrid.
'Seems a shametorow, though,' said Hagrid, giving Harry 

another of his sideways looks.
'Of course not,' said Harry, eager to see more magic.
'Course,' said Hagrid.
'Hagrid,' said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, 'did you 
say there are dragons at Gringotts?'
'Well, so they say,' said Hagrid.
'Good,' said Hagrid.
'Ifyouknow where to go,' said Hagrid.
'This is it,' said Hagrid, coming to a halt, 'the Leaky Cauldron.
If Hagrid hadn't pointed it 
 



 
 
out, Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there.
'Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business,' said Hagrid, clapping 
his great hand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees 
buckle.
said Hagrid.
Hagrid grinned at Harry.
'Welcome,' said Hagrid, 'to Diagon Alley.'
'Like I said, yeh'd be madtotry an' rob it,' said Hagrid.
Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.
'Morning,' said Hagrid to a free goblin.
'Can't tellyouthat,' said Hagrid mysteriously.
'Stalagmite's got an "m" in it,' said Hagrid.
she said, when Harry started to speak.
'Yes,' said Harry.
'No,' said Harry.
'That's Hagrid,' said Harry, pleased to know something the boy 
didn't.
'He's the gamekeeper,' said Harry.
'They're dead,' said Harry shortly.
said Hagrid.
When they had left the shop, he 
said, 'Hagrid, what's Quidditch?'
'Don' mention it,' said Hagrid gruffly.
'Hello,' said Harry awkwardly.
'It was, sir, yes,' said Hagrid.
'Er – yes, they did, yes,' said Hagrid, shuffling his feet.
'Oh, no, sir,' said Hagrid quickly.
'Hmmm,' said Mr Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look.
'Er – well, I'm right-handed,' said Harry.
Yer very quiet,' said Hagrid.

'I don't know,' said Harry, realising this for the first time.
'Yes,' said Harry.
she said kindly, and Harry 
nodded.
'Er – OK,' said Harry.
said Harry.
'Oh, him,' said Harry.
said one of 

the twins.
'Shut up,' said Ron.
said their mother.
said one of the 

twins.
'Shut up,' said Ron again.
'Harry,' said the other twin, 'did we introduce ourselves?
'Bye,' said Harry and Ron.
'Yes,' said Harry, 'but I can't remember it.'
said Ron eagerly.
'Wow,' said Ron.
'Er – yes, I think so,' said Ron.
'Five,' said Ron.
said Harry.
'You said You-Know-Who's name!'
'Go 
on –' 

'You don't want this, it's all dry,' said Ron.
'No,' said Ron.
said Harry.
said Ron.
said Ron.
'Help yourself,' said Harry.
'He'll turn up,' said Harry.
'Don't know why he's so bothered,' said Ron.
said the girl.
'Harry Potter,' said Harry.
said Hermione.
said Harry, feeling dazed.
'Gryffindor,' said Ron.
'Yeah,' said Ron.
he said.
'Yes,' said Harry.
Both Harry and Ron stood up.
'Say that again,' he said.
'I think he's been knocked out,' Ron said to Harry.
'I've heard of his family,' said Ron darkly.

'The firs'-years, Professor McGonagall,' said Hagrid.
Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a 
doorway to the right – the rest of the school must already be here 
– but Professor McGonagall showed the first-years into a small 
empty chamber off the hall.
'Welcome to Hogwarts,' said Professor McGonagall.
'I shall return when we are ready for you,' said Professor 
McGonagall.
he asked Ron.
Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he 

was joking.'
said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them.
said the Friar.
'Move along now,' said a sharp voice.
Professor McGonagall had returned.
Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall 
silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first-years.
Ron whispered to Harry.
'When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the 
stool to be sorted,' she said.
What 
if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until 
Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had 
obviously been a mistake and he'd better get back on the train?
'Hmm,' said a small voice in his ear.
said the small voice.
'Well done, Ron, excellent,' said Percy Weasley pompously 
across Harry as 'Zabini, Blaise' was made a Slytherin.
he said.
said Percy airily.
'That does look good,' said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching 
Harry cut up his steak.
'I haven't eaten for nearly five hundred years,' said the ghost.
said Ron suddenly.
'Like this,' he said irritably.
Looking pleased at the stunned looks on 
their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back on to his 
neck, coughed and said, 'So – new Gryffindors!
'I've never asked,' said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.
'I'm half and half,' said Seamus.
said Ron.
'Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch,' said Neville, 

'but the family thought I was all Muggle for ages.
Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore.
asked Percy.
he asked 
Percy.
'Must be,' said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore.
'Everyone pick their favourite tune,' said Dumbledore, 'and off 
we go!'
'Ah, music,' he said, wiping his eyes.
'Peeves,' Percy whispered to the first-years.
he said, with an evil cackle.
'You want to watch out for Peeves,' said Percy, as they set off 
again.
she said.
'Caput Draconis,' said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to 

reveal a round hole in the wall.
Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings
.

      Summarization of CHAPTER 8
##############################################


Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of 
him on their very first morning.
Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron.
Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar 
on his porridge.
'Double Potions with the Slytherins,' said Ron.
'Wish McGonagall favoured us,' said Harry.
Dear Harry, (it said, in a very untidy scrawl) 

I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to 
come and have a cup of tea with me around three?
Hagrid 
 

Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled 'Yes, please, see you later' on 
the back of the note and sent Hedwig off again.
It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, 
because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that 
had happened to him so far.
Snape didn't dislike Harry – he 
hated him.
'Ah, yes,' he said softly, 'Harry Potter.
His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had 
none of Hagrid's warmth.
said Snape suddenly.
'I don't know, sir,' said Harry.
'I don't know,' said Harry quietly.
Over 
the noise, Snape said, 'And a point will be taken from Gryffindor 
house for your cheek, Potter.'
Then 

he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to 
Neville.
'Cheer up,' said Ron.
Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?'
'Hang on,' he said.
'Make yerselves at home,' said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who 
bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears.
Like Hagrid, 
Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.
'This is Ron,' Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water 
into a large teapot and putting rock cakes on to a plate.
said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles.
The rock cakes almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron 
pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their 
first lessons.
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch 'that old 
git'.
Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson.
Hagrid, like Ron, told 
Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the 
students.
said Hagrid.
Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet 

his eyes when he said that.
Hagrid asked Ron.
Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose.
While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, 
Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under 
the tea cosy.
'But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your 
noses out if you know what's good for you,' said a Gringotts 
spokesgoblin this afternoon.
Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had 
tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date.
'Hagrid!'
said Harry.
There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet 
Harry's eyes this time.
As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their 
pockets weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to 
refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had 
given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid.
Had Hagrid 
collected that package just in time?
And did 
Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn't want to tell 
Harry?

'Typical,' said Harry darkly.
'You don't know you'll make a fool of yourself,' said Ron reasonably
.
Harry and Ron jumped to their feet.
'Just looking,' he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and 

Goyle behind him.
Perhaps brooms, like 
horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was 
a quaver in Neville's voice that said only too clearly that he wanted 
to keep his feet on the ground.
Harry and Ron were delighted when she 
told Malfoy he'd been doing it wrong for years.
said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something 
out of the grass.
'Give that here, Malfoy,' said Harry quietly.
said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.
'Follow me, you two,' said Professor McGonagall, and they 
marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.
'Absolutely,' said Professor McGonagall crisply.
'He's just the build for a Seeker, too,' said Wood, now walking 

around Harry and staring at him.
'Your father would have been proud,' she said.
he said.
'I start training next week,' said Harry.
'You're a lot braver now you're back on the ground and you've 
got your little friends with you,' said Harry coolly.
'I'd take you on any time on my own,' said Malfoy.
'Of course he has,' said Ron, wheeling round.
'Crabbe,' he said.
When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.
said Harry.
'Well, a second's there to take over if you die,' said Ron casually, 

getting started at last on his cold pie.
said Ron.
'And it's really none of your business,' said Harry.
'Goodbye,' said Ron.
said Ron furiously.
'Come on,' he said to Ron.
'That's your problem,' said Ron.
'I'm coming with you,' she said.
'You've got some nerve –' said Ron loudly.
said Harry sharply.
said Harry.
'Fine,' said Neville, showing them.
said Neville, scrambling to his feet.
'We've got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,' said Ron, 'quickly 
as possible.'
'Malfoy tricked you,' Hermione said to Harry.
It was a while before any of them said anything.
said Ron finally.
'No, we don't mind,' he said.
The dog was guarding something ... 
What had Hagrid said?

'Or both,' said Harry.
'That's a broomstick,' he said, throwing it back to Harry with a 
mixture of jealousy and spite on his face.
'It's not any old broomstick,' he said, 'it's a Nimbus Two 

Thousand.
Ron grinned at Harry.
'Potter's been sent a broomstick, Professor,' said Malfoy quickly.
'Yes, yes, that's right,' said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.
'A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,' said Harry, fighting not to laugh 
at the look of horror on Malfoy's face.
said Harry.
'Yes, don't stop now,' said Ron, 'it's doing us so much good.'
'Very nice,' said Wood, his eyes glinting.
'Right,' said Wood.
'This ball's called the Quaffle,' said Wood.
said Wood curiously.
'Never mind,' said Harry quickly.
'Three Chasers, one Keeper,' said Harry, who was determined to 
remember it all.
'I'll show you now,' said Wood.
'I'm going to show you what the Bludgers do,' Wood said.
'Stand back,' Wood warned Harry.
'Very good,' said Wood.
'This,' said Wood, 'is the Golden Snitch, and it's the most 
important ball of the lot.
Harry didn't miss a single one, and Wood was delighted.
'It's no wonder no one can stand her,' he said to Harry as they 

pushed their way into the crowded corridor.
said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable.
'Don't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid,' said Ron.
'He's heading for the third floor,' Harry said, but Ron held up 

his hand.
'Good idea,' said Ron nervously.
'Oh, no,' said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.
they said together.
Harry said desperately to Ron, and seizing a tap he 
threw it as hard as he could against the wall.
The troll couldn't feel 
Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long 
bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wand had still been in his 
hand when he'd jumped – it had gone straight up one of the troll's 
nostrils.
Harry got to his feet.
'I don't think so,' said Harry.
Professor McGonagall was looking at 
Ron and Harry.
said Professor 
McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice.
Harry looked at Ron, 
who was still standing with his wand in the air.
Harry looked at the 
floor.
Harry stuck his wand 

up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club.
'Well – in that case ...' said Professor McGonagall, staring at the 
three of them.
'Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for 
this,' said Professor McGonagall.
Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.

Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping.
Harry showed him.
'Library books are not to be taken outside the school,' said 

Snape.
'Dunno, but I hope it's really hurting him,' said Ron bitterly.
Harry, 
Ron and Hermione sat together next to a window.
Hermione was 
checking Harry and Ron's Charms homework for them.
'Rather you than me,' they said together, but Harry had an idea 
that Snape wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening.
Harry gulped.
Ron asked as Harry joined them.
'No – he wouldn't,' she said.
'I'm with Harry.
'Harry, you need your strength,' said Seamus Finnigan.
'Thanks, Seamus,' said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on 

his sausages.
'OK, men,' he said.
'And women,' said Chaser Angelina Johnson.
'The big one,' said Fred Weasley.
'The one we've all been waiting for,' said George.
'Shut up, you two,' said Wood.
'Hagrid!'
'Bin watchin' from me hut,' said Hagrid, patting a large pair of 

binoculars round his neck, 'But it isn't the same as bein' in the 
crowd.
'Nope,' said Ron.
'Kept outta trouble, though, that's somethin',' said Hagrid, 

raising his binoculars and peering skywards at the speck that was 
Harry.
'Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,' Wood 
had said.
'All right there, Harry?'
Harry saw it.
A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below – 
Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose and Harry's broom 
span off course, Harry holding on for dear life.
'Dunno what Harry thinks he's doing,' Hagrid mumbled.
Harry's 
broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it.
'Can't have,' Hagrid said, his voice shaking.
'He's doing something – jinxing the broom,' said Hermione.
Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry.
Ron said.
'Rubbish,' said Hagrid, who hadn't heard a word of what had 
gone on next to him in the stands.
Harry, Ron and Hermione looked at each other, wondering 
what to tell him.
he said.
said Harry eagerly.
'Now, don't ask me any more,' said Hagrid gruffly.
'Rubbish,' said Hagrid again.
said Hagrid hotly.
said Harry.

'I'll get him,' said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy's back, 'one 
of these days, I'll get him –' 

'I hate them both,' said Harry, 'Malfoy and Snape.'
'Come on, cheer up, it's nearly Christmas,' said Hagrid.
'Just one,' said Hermione.
'And that reminds me – Harry, Ron, 

we've got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library,' 
'Oh yeah, you're right,' said Ron, tearing his eyes away from 

Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his 
wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.
said Hagrid, following them out of the Hall.
'We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all,' said 
Hermione.
'I'm sayin' nothin',' said Hagrid flatly.
'Just have to find out for ourselves, then,' said Ron, and they 

left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.
'Nothing,' said Harry.
said 
Hermione.
'And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,' 
said Ron.
'Very safe, as they're both dentists,' said Hermione.
'Happy Christmas,' said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of 
bed and pulled on his dressing-gown.
'You too,' said Harry.
said Ron, turning to his own 
pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry's.
'That's friendly,' said Harry.
he said.
'You can keep it,' said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was.
'I think I know who that one's from,' said Ron, going a bit pink 

and pointing to a very lumpy parcel.
'That's really nice of her,' said Harry, trying the fudge, which 
was very tasty.
'It's an Invisibility Cloak,' said Ron, a look of awe on his face.
said Ron suddenly.
'I'd give anything for one of these,' he said.
'Nothing,' said Harry.
Use it well, the 
note had said.
Harry said nothing.
* 
'You could have woken me up,' said Ron, crossly.
'I'd like to see your mum and dad,' Ron said eagerly.
'You can see them any old time,' said Ron.
said Ron.
'I'm freezing,' said Ron.
Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he 

couldn't see his family any more, just Ron in his paisley pyjamas.
he said.
And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.
said Ron.
But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get 

back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him.
'Strange how short-sighted being invisible can make you,' said 

Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.
'So,' said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor 

with Harry, 'you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the 
delights of the Mirror of Erised.'
Then he said slowly, 'It shows us what we want 
... whatever we want ...' 

'Yes and no,' said Dumbledore quietly.
'One can never have enough socks,' said Dumbledore.

'You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you 
mad,' said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.
'It's not my fault,' said Wood.
Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, 
something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.
'Don't talk to me for a moment,' said Ron when Harry sat down 
next to him.
'Don't play,' said Hermione at once.
'Say you're ill,' said Ron.
'Really break your leg,' said Ron.
'I can't,' said Harry.
Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit 
with Harry and Ron.
'Malfoy,' said Neville shakily.
said Ron.
'You're worth twelve of Malfoy,' Harry said.
'Dumbledore again,' he said.
Then he looked 

up at Ron and Hermione.
said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she'd 
looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the 
pages, muttering to herself.
said Ron grumpily.
said Harry and Ron.
said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished.
said Harry.
'And no wonder we couldn't find Flamel in that Study of Recent 
Developments in Wizardry,' said Ron.
It wasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch 
team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.
I'm going to play,' he told Ron and Hermione.
'Just as long as we're not wiping you off the pitch,' said 
Hermione.
* 
As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more 
nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione.
Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been 
secretly practising the Leg-Locker Curse.
Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still 

not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, 'You tell him, 
Neville.'
said Hermione suddenly.
'Harry –!'
said Malfoy.
Ron snapped.
'Come on, Harry!'
'Ron!
Ron!
Harry's won!
'Well done,' said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could 
hear.
* 
'Harry where have you been?'
shouted Ron, thumping Harry on 
the back.
'Never mind that now,' said Harry breathlessly.
said Hermione in alarm.
'It'll be gone by next Tuesday,' said Ron.

said Hagrid again.
They'll think 
I've toldyou–' 

'See you later, then,' said Harry.
Hagrid shuffled off.
said Hermione thoughtfully
.
'I'm going to see what section he was in,' said Ron, who'd had 

enough of working.
'Hagrid's always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I 
ever met him,' said Harry.
'But it's against our laws,' said Ron.
said Harry.
'Of course there are,' said Ron.
'So what on earth's Hagrid up to?'
said Hermione.
Hagrid called, 'Who is it?'
'Yes,' said Harry.
Hagrid frowned at him.
'O' course I can't,' he said.
Harry and Ron 
beamed at Hermione.
said Harry anxiously.
'Not a soul knows except me an' Dumbledore,' said Hagrid 
proudly.
'Can't, Harry, sorry,' said Hagrid.
'Hagrid – what's that?'
'Ah,' said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard.
said Ron, crouching over the 

fire to get a closer look at the egg.
'Won it,' said Hagrid.
said 
Hermione.
'Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,' she said.
But Hagrid wasn't listening.
said Hagrid.
'Hagrid,' said Hermione, 'how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks 

grow, exactly?'
'I can't,' said Hagrid.
'I've decided to call him Norbert,' said Hagrid, looking at the 
dragon with misty eyes.
'Hagrid,' said Harry loudly, 'give it a fortnight and Norbert's 

going to be as long as your house.
'Charlie,' he said.
'You're losing it, too,' said Ron.
said Ron.
'How about it, Hagrid?'
said Harry, hurrying to let her in.
'We've got the Invisibility Cloak,' said Harry.
'It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday,' said Hermione, but 

this didn't soothe Ron at all.
he said in a hoarse voice.
'He's got lots o' rats an' some brandy fer the journey,' said 

Hagrid in a muffled voice.

'Harry!'
said Harry miserably.
Harry told them what he'd heard.
said Ron.
So what do we do, Harry?'
said Harry.
Harry's heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid 

it wouldn't be so bad.
All 
right, Harry, Hermione?'
said Hagrid, frowning at Filch.
'I'm not going in that Forest,' he said, and Harry was pleased to 

hear the note of panic in his voice.
'All right, but I warn yeh, he's a coward,' said Hagrid.
A little way into it they 
reached a fork in the earth path and Harry, Hermione and Hagrid 
took the left path while Malfoy, Neville and Fang took the right.
Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.
Harry asked.
'Not fast enough,' said Hagrid.
'You all right, Hermione?'
Harry suggested.
Harry and 
Hermione's jaws dropped.
'Oh, it's you, Ronan,' said Hagrid in relief.
'Good evening to you, Hagrid,' said Ronan.
This is Harry Potter an' 
Hermione Granger, by the way.
'Good evening,' said Ronan.
'Yeah,' said Hagrid, glancing up too.
'Yeah,' said Hagrid, 'but haveyouseen anythin', Ronan?
'Hullo, Bane,' said Hagrid.
'We've heard,' said Hagrid grumpily.
said Harry.
'Hagrid!
Right, we're changin' groups – Neville, you stay with 
me an' Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an' this idiot.
said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.
said Firenze.
Harry didn't have a clue what was going on.
'No,' said Harry, startled by the odd question.
'Do you mean,' Harry croaked, 'that was Vol–' 
'Harry!
Harry, are you all right?'
'I'm fine,' said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying.
Harry slid off his back.
'Good luck, Harry Potter,' said Firenze.
Harry couldn't sit down.
Harry wasn't listening.

'I'm not ill,' said Harry.
said Ron sleepily.
'I've just thought of something,' said Harry.
'Yes, please,' said Ron, but Harry cut across him.
'We've got to go to Dumbledore,' said Harry.
'We want to see Professor Dumbledore,' said Hermione, rather 

bravely, Harry and Ron thought.
said Harry frantically.
'It's obvious,' said Ron.
Harry said.
said Ron.
said Hermione.
'You're right, Harry,' said Hermione in a small voice.
said Ron.
'You're going out again,' he said.
'No, no, no,' said Hermione.
said Neville.
'Don't be stupid,' said Ron.
'We're coming,' said Hermione.
Hermione said anxiously.
said Ron.
'Right,' said Ron.
said Hermione.
said Ron.
'Probably,' said Harry.
said Ron.
Harry said suddenly, 'they're keys!
said Ron.
said Hermione nervously.
'I think,' said Ron, 'we're going to have to be chessmen.'
'I'm going to be a knight,' said Ron.
'Snape's,' said Harry.
'Brilliant,' said Hermione.
'Of course not,' said Hermione.
'Got it,' she said.
'You drink that,' said Harry.
'Hermione!'
said Hermione.
'You drink first,' said Harry.
'Positive,' said Hermione.
said Harry anxiously.

gasped Harry.
Harry couldn't take it in.
Harry 
gasped.
said Quirrell impatiently.
'Harry Potter ...' it whispered.
the face said.
shrieked Voldemort again and Quirrell 
lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of him, 
both hands around Harry's neck – Harry's scar was almost blinding 
him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.
Quirrell screamed and tried to throw 
Harry off – the pain in Harry's head was building – he couldn't see 
– he could only hear Quirrell's terrible shrieks and Voldemort's 
yells of 'KILL HIM!
and other voices, maybe in 
Harry's own head, crying, 'Harry!
Harry!'
'Good afternoon, Harry,' said Dumbledore.
Harry stared at him.
said Harry blankly.
Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry's face.
said Harry.
'No, Harry, he has not.
When he had found his voice again, Harry said, 'And the 
Invisibility Cloak – do you know who sent it to me?'
'Quirrell said Snape –' 
'Professor Snape, Harry.'
'Yes ...' said Dumbledore dreamily.
'Harry!'
'Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to – Dumbledore was 

so worried –' 
'The whole school's talking about it,' said Ron.
Harry told 
them everything: Quirrell; the Mirror; the Stone and Voldemort.
said Ron finally.
'That's what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that – what was 
it?
said Harry.
He 
already knew – he just said, "Harry's gone after him, hasn't he?"
said Ron.
'No, it isn't,' said Harry thoughtfully.
'Oh good,' said Harry.
said Harry anxiously and at last 
Hagrid gave a weak chuckle.
Dumbledore said cheerfully.
'Ahem,' said Dumbledore.
'Third – to Mr Harry Potter ...' said Dumbledore.
This didn't worry 
Harry.
'Thanks,' said Harry.
'Not where I'm going, I promise you,' said Harry.
'Harry Potter!'
she said.
'Very,' said Harry.
'Oh, I will,' said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that 
was spreading over his face.
