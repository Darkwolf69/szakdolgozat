'No,' she said sharply.
'Harry.
I know ...' he said heavily.
'We can only guess,' said Dumbledore.
'Yes,' said Professor McGonagall.
Harry Potter come and live here!'
'I would trust Hagrid with my life,' said Dumbledore.
'Hagrid,' said Dumbledore, sounding relieved.
'Yes,' said Dumbledore.
'Well,' said Dumbledore finally, 'that's that.
'Yeah,' said Hagrid in a very muffled voice.
'Nearly,' said Harry.
Harry groaned.
Harry didn't look it, but he 
was very fast.
Harry hated it there.
'I won't blow up the house,' said Harry, but they weren't listening.
He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the 
council, Harry, the bank and Harry were just a few of his favourite 
subjects.
'I know they don't,' said Harry.
But he wished he hadn't said anything.
Harry stared.
Harry asked.
Harry 
peered at it.
But worst 
of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, 
'Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?'
At school, Harry had no one.
'No thanks,' said Harry.
Harry looked in the bowl again.
'Oh,' he said.
'Make Harry get it.'
'Get the post, Harry.'
said Dudley suddenly.
said Harry, trying to snatch it back.
Harry didn't move.
'No,' he said finally.
said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had 
squeezed through the door.
'It was not a mistake,' said Harry angrily.
said Harry.
This reminded Harry of something.
he said.
he said cheerfully
.
Harry couldn't sleep.
he said stupidly.
'An' here's Harry!'
said the giant.
he said.
Harry looked up at the giant.
'Call me Hagrid,' he said, 'everyone does.
'Er – no,' said Harry.
'Sorry,' Harry said quickly.
asked Harry.
'I know some things,' he said.
he said finally.
said Harry eagerly.
gasped Harry.
'He's not going,' he said.
said Harry, interested.
'A Muggle,' said Hagrid.
said Harry.
Harry had gone very white.
Harry suggested.
'Sorry,' he said.
Harry looked into the fire.
said Hagrid.
asked Harry.
'You can kip under that,' he said.
said Harry loudly.
'Flew,' said Hagrid.
'Of course not,' said Harry, eager to see more magic.
Harry asked.
Harry asked, before he could stop 
himself. 

'
'Course,' said Hagrid.
Harry couldn't blame them.
'Well, so they say,' said Hagrid.
'Good,' said Hagrid.
'Ifyouknow where to go,' said Hagrid.
* 
Harry had never been to London before.
Harry didn't know what to say.
said Hagrid.
Come on, Harry.'
'Right, stand back, Harry.'
'Like I said, yeh'd be madtotry an' rob it,' said Hagrid.
Harry asked.
'Stalagmite's got an "m" in it,' said Hagrid.
Harry asked.
she said, when Harry started to speak.
'Yes,' said Harry.
'No,' said Harry.
'No,' Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch 

could be.
'No,' said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.
'That's Hagrid,' said Harry, pleased to know something the boy 
didn't.
'Oh,' said the boy, 'I've heard of him.
'He's the gamekeeper,' said Harry.
'I think he's brilliant,' said Harry coldly.
'They're dead,' said Harry shortly.
said Hagrid.
When they had left the shop, he 
said, 'Hagrid, what's Quidditch?'
'Don't make me feel worse,' said Harry.
'Don' mention it,' said Hagrid gruffly.
Harry jumped.
Harry Potter.'
'It was, sir, yes,' said Hagrid.
'Oh, no, sir,' said Hagrid quickly.
'Er – well, I'm right-handed,' said Harry.
Harry tried.
Harry took the wand.
Harry swallowed.
Harry shivered.
Harry kept looking around.
'You all right, Harry?
Yer very quiet,' said Hagrid.
'Don' you worry, Harry.
Harry didn't say anything.
'I don't know,' said Harry, realising this for the first time.
said the boys' mother.
'Yes,' said Harry.
she said kindly, and Harry 
nodded.
'Not to worry,' she said.
'Er – OK,' said Harry.
Harry walked more quickly.
'He is,' said the first twin.
he added to Harry.
said Harry.
'Oh, him,' said Harry.
said one of 

the twins.
'Shut up,' said Ron.
said their mother.
'You should have said something, we had no 
idea.'
said one of the 

twins.
'Shut up,' said Ron again.
'Harry Potter!'
'Harry,' said the other twin, 'did we introduce ourselves?
'Bye,' said Harry and Ron.
'Are you really Harry Potter?'
Harry nodded.
'Yes,' said Harry, 'but I can't remember it.'
said Ron eagerly.
'Wow,' said Ron.
'Er – yes, I think so,' said Ron.
'I heard you went to live with Muggles,' said Ron.
'Five,' said Ron.
said Harry.
'You said You-Know-Who's name!'
said Ron, sounding both 

shocked and impressed.
Harry went out into the corridor.
'Go 
on –' 

'You don't want this, it's all dry,' said Ron.
'No,' said Ron.
said Harry.
said Ron.
said Ron.
'Help yourself,' said Harry.
'He'll turn up,' said Harry.
'Don't know why he's so bothered,' said Ron.
Neville's lost one,' she said.
said the girl.
She said all this very fast.
'Harry Potter,' said Harry.
said Hermione.
said Harry, feeling dazed.
'Whatever house I'm in, I hope she's not in it,' said Ron.
asked Harry.
'Gryffindor,' said Ron.
'Yeah,' said Ron.
Harry stared.
he said.
'Yes,' said Harry.
He turned back to Harry.
He held out his hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it.
Both Harry and Ron stood up.
'Say that again,' he said.
'I think he's been knocked out,' Ron said to Harry.
'I've heard of his family,' said Ron darkly.
Said they'd been bewitched.
All right there, Harry?'
'The firs'-years, Professor McGonagall,' said Hagrid.
Harry swallowed.
said the Friar.
Ron whispered to Harry.
'The Harry Potter?'
said the small voice.
Harry grinned back.
he said.
said Ron suddenly.
'Like this,' he said irritably.
said Ron.
Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.
she said.
'Double Potions with the Slytherins,' said Ron.
'Ah, yes,' he said softly, 'Harry Potter.
said Snape suddenly.
'I don't know, sir,' said Harry.
'I don't know,' said Harry quietly.
'Cheer up,' said Ron.
'Hang on,' he said.
said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles.
said Hagrid.
said Harry.
'Typical,' said Harry darkly.
'Give that here, Malfoy,' said Harry quietly.
Harry ignored her.
'HARRY POTTER!'
he said.
'I'd take you on any time on my own,' said Malfoy.
'Of course he has,' said Ron, wheeling round.
'Crabbe,' he said.
When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.
said Harry.
said Ron.
'And it's really none of your business,' said Harry.
'Goodbye,' said Ron.
said Ron furiously.
'Come on,' he said to Ron.
'That's your problem,' said Ron.
'I'm coming with you,' she said.
'You've got some nerve –' said Ron loudly.
said Harry sharply.
said Harry.
'Malfoy tricked you,' Hermione said to Harry.
It was a while before any of them said anything.
said Ron finally.
Harry suggested.
'No, we don't mind,' he said.
The dog was guarding something ... 
What had Hagrid said?
'Or both,' said Harry.
Ron grinned at Harry.
said Harry.
'Yes, don't stop now,' said Ron, 'it's doing us so much good.'
'Right,' said Wood.
'Never mind,' said Harry quickly.
'I'll show you now,' said Wood.
'Very good,' said Wood.
Harry shook his head.
said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable.
'Don't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid,' said Ron.
Harry whispered.
'He's heading for the third floor,' Harry said, but Ron held up 

his hand.
'Good idea,' said Ron nervously.
'Oh, no,' said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.
Harry gasped.
they said together.
Harry got to his feet.
'I don't think so,' said Harry.
Professor McGonagall was looking at 
Ron and Harry.
Harry looked at the 
floor.
Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.
Harry showed him.
Ron asked as Harry joined them.
'No – he wouldn't,' she said.
'I'm with Harry.
Harry felt terrible.
'Nope,' said Ron.
'Harry hasn't had much to do yet.'
'All right there, Harry?'
Harry saw it.
Harry's 
broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it.
'Can't have,' Hagrid said, his voice shaking.
Ron said.
Harry, Ron and Hermione looked at each other, wondering 
what to tell him.
he said.
said Harry eagerly.
'Now, don't ask me any more,' said Hagrid gruffly.
'Rubbish,' said Hagrid again.
said Hagrid hotly.
said Harry.
He was looking over at Harry as he spoke.
'I'll get him,' said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy's back, 'one 
of these days, I'll get him –' 

'I hate them both,' said Harry, 'Malfoy and Snape.'
'Just one,' said Hermione.
said Hagrid, following them out of the Hall.
Harry 
added.
'Just have to find out for ourselves, then,' said Ron, and they 

left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.
'Nothing,' said Harry.
said 
Hermione.
'And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,' 
said Ron.
'You too,' said Harry.
said Ron, turning to his own 
pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry's.
'That's friendly,' said Harry.
he said.
'You can keep it,' said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was.
Harry picked it up and felt it.
Harry looked down at his feet, but they had gone.
said Ron suddenly.
Harry stared at the note.
'I'd give anything for one of these,' he said.
'Nothing,' said Harry.
Should Harry wake him?
Harry said nothing.
Harry looked 
over his shoulder – but, still, no one was there.
It 
stuck up at the back, just like Harry's did.
And slowly, Harry looked 

into the faces of the other people in the mirror and saw other 
pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old 
man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees – Harry 
was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.
* 
'You could have woken me up,' said Ron, crossly.
'I'd like to see your mum and dad,' Ron said eagerly.
'You can see them any old time,' said Ron.
Harry couldn't eat.
said Ron.
'I'm freezing,' said Ron.
Harry hissed.
Harry whispered.
he said.
And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.
said Ron.
Except – 
'So – back again, Harry?'
Harry shook his head.
Harry thought.
Then he said slowly, 'It shows us what we want 
... whatever we want ...' 

'Yes and no,' said Dumbledore quietly.
Harry stood up.
Harry stared.
'You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you 
mad,' said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.
'Don't talk to me for a moment,' said Ron when Harry sat down 
next to him.
'Don't play,' said Hermione at once.
'Say you're ill,' said Ron.
'Really break your leg,' said Ron.
'I can't,' said Harry.
said Ron.
'You're worth twelve of Malfoy,' Harry said.
'Thanks, Harry ...
'Dumbledore again,' he said.
said Ron grumpily.
said Harry and Ron.
said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished.
said Harry.
said Hermione suddenly.
'Harry –!'
said Malfoy.
'Come on, Harry!'
'Ron!
Ron!
Harry's won!
'Well done,' said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could 
hear.
* 
'Harry where have you been?'
'Never mind that now,' said Harry breathlessly.
said Hermione in alarm.
'It'll be gone by next Tuesday,' said Ron.
said Hagrid again.
They'll think 
I've toldyou–' 

'See you later, then,' said Harry.
said Hermione thoughtfully
.
'I'm going to see what section he was in,' said Ron, who'd had 

enough of working.
'But it's against our laws,' said Ron.
said Harry.
'Of course there are,' said Ron.
said Hermione.
'Yes,' said Harry.
'O' course I can't,' he said.
Harry and Ron 
beamed at Hermione.
Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he 

was.
said Harry anxiously.
'Can't, Harry, sorry,' said Hagrid.
Harry looked at it, too.
'Won it,' said Hagrid.
said 
Hermione.
Harry whispered.
Harry didn't like the look on 
Malfoy's face at all.
said Hagrid.
'I can't,' said Hagrid.
Harry suddenly turned to Ron.
'Charlie,' he said.
'You're losing it, too,' said Ron.
said Ron.
said Harry, hurrying to let her in.
'We've got the Invisibility Cloak,' said Harry.
'It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday,' said Hermione, but 

this didn't soothe Ron at all.
'Harry!'
said Harry miserably.
Harry told them what he'd heard.
said Ron.
So what do we do, Harry?'
said Harry.
'Abou' time,' he said.
All 
right, Harry, Hermione?'
said Hagrid, frowning at Filch.
Harry asked.
'Not fast enough,' said Hagrid.
Harry suggested.
'Oh, it's you, Ronan,' said Hagrid in relief.
'Good evening to you, Hagrid,' said Ronan.
This is Harry Potter an' 
Hermione Granger, by the way.
'Yeah,' said Hagrid, glancing up too.
'Hullo, Bane,' said Hagrid.
'We've heard,' said Hagrid grumpily.
said Harry.
said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.
'You are the Potter boy,' he said.
said Firenze.
'Do you mean,' Harry croaked, 'that was Vol–' 
'Harry!
Harry, are you all right?'
Harry slid off his back.
'Good luck, Harry Potter,' said Firenze.
Harry couldn't sit down.
Harry wasn't listening.
'I'm not ill,' said Harry.
said Ron sleepily.
'I've just thought of something,' said Harry.
'Yes, please,' said Ron, but Harry cut across him.
'Forget I said it!
'We've got to go to Dumbledore,' said Harry.
'We want to see Professor Dumbledore,' said Hermione, rather 

bravely, Harry and Ron thought.
Harry swallowed – now what?
said Harry frantically.
Harry flushed.
'It's obvious,' said Ron.
'I'm sorry, Harry!'
Harry said.
said Ron.
said Hermione.
After what McGonagall and Snape 

have said?
Harry shouted.
'You're right, Harry,' said Hermione in a small voice.
'I'll use the Invisibility Cloak,' said Harry.
said Ron.
'Of course not,' said Hermione briskly.
Harry and Ron didn't talk much.
'You're going out again,' he said.
'No, no, no,' said Hermione.
'You can't go out,' said Neville, 'you'll be caught again.
'You don't understand,' said Harry, 'this is important.'
said Neville.
'Yes, but not to us,' said Ron in exasperation.
Harry turned to Hermione.
'Do something,' he said desperately.
Harry whispered.
'We had to, Neville, no time to explain,' said Harry.
'Oh, let's kick her, just this once,' Ron whispered in Harry's ear, 
but Harry shook his head.
'Brilliant, Harry!'
'Well, there you are,' Harry said quietly.
'Don't be stupid,' said Ron.
'We're coming,' said Hermione.
'Looks like a harp,' said Ron.
Hermione said anxiously.
said Ron.
Then he looked up at Ron and said, 'If anything 
happens to me, don't follow.
'Right,' said Ron.
'Lucky this plant thing's here, really,' said Ron.
said Hermione.
said Ron.
'Probably,' said Harry.
said Ron.
Harry said suddenly, 'they're keys!
Harry whispered.
said Ron.
said Hermione nervously.
'I think,' said Ron, 'we're going to have to be chessmen.'
'I'm going to be a knight,' said Ron.
'Had to let that happen,' said Ron, looking shaken.
'Yes ...' said Ron softly, 'it's the only way ...
Harry and Hermione shouted.
'He'll be all right,' said Harry, trying to convince himself.
Harry whispered.
'Snape's,' said Harry.
'Brilliant,' said Hermione.
'Of course not,' said Hermione.
'Got it,' she said.
'There's only enough there for one of us,' he said.
'You drink that,' said Harry.
'But Harry – what if You-Know-Who's with him?'
said Harry, pointing at his 

scar.
'Harry – you're a great wizard, you know.'
'I'm not as good as you,' said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let 

go of him.
said Hermione.
'You drink first,' said Harry.
'Positive,' said Hermione.
said Harry anxiously.
gasped Harry.
Harry couldn't take it in.
Harry 
gasped.
Harry walked towards him.
'Get out of the way,' he said.
'Harry Potter ...' it whispered.
the face said.
Harry shouted suddenly.
and other voices, maybe in 
Harry's own head, crying, 'Harry!
Harry!'
'Good afternoon, Harry,' said Dumbledore.
Harry stared at him.
Harry swallowed and looked around him.
said Harry blankly.
said Harry.
'No, Harry, he has not.
When he had found his voice again, Harry said, 'And the 
Invisibility Cloak – do you know who sent it to me?'
'Quirrell said Snape –' 
'Professor Snape, Harry.'
'Harry!'
'Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to – Dumbledore was 

so worried –' 
'The whole school's talking about it,' said Ron.
said Ron finally.
'That's what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that – what was 
it?
'I always said he was off his rocker,' said Ron, looking quite 
impressed at how mad his hero was.
said Harry.
'Well, I got back all right,' said Hermione.
He 
already knew – he just said, "Harry's gone after him, hasn't he?"
said Ron.
'No, it isn't,' said Harry thoughtfully.
'Oh good,' said Harry.
Dumbledore said cheerfully.
'Ahem,' said Dumbledore.
'Third – to Mr Harry Potter ...' said Dumbledore.
This didn't worry 
Harry.
It was a shame, but as Ron 
said, you couldn't have everything in life.
'Thanks,' said Harry.
'Still famous,' said Ron, grinning at him.
'Not where I'm going, I promise you,' said Harry.
'Harry Potter!'
she said.
'Very,' said Harry.
'You must be Harry's family!'
said Mrs Weasley.
