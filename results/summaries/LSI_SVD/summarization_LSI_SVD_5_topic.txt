'No,' she said sharply.
'Harry.
'How did you know it was me?'
'I know that,' said Professor McGonagall irritably.
'I 

 



 
 
know ...
I know ...' he said heavily.
'Yes,' said Professor McGonagall.
'Hagrid's bringing him.'
'I would trust Hagrid with my life,' said Dumbledore.
'Hagrid,' said Dumbledore, sounding relieved.
'Yes,' said Dumbledore.
Well – give him here, Hagrid – we'd better 
get this over with.'
asked Hagrid.
'Well,' said Dumbledore finally, 'that's that.
'Yeah,' said Hagrid in a very muffled voice.
'Nearly,' said Harry.
'I know they don't,' said Harry.
Harry stared.
Harry asked.
But worst 
of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, 
'Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?'
At school, Harry had no one.
'No thanks,' said Harry.
'Oh,' he said.
said Dudley suddenly.
Harry didn't move.
'No,' he said finally.
said Harry.
he said.
'An' here's Harry!'
said the giant.
he said.
'Call me Hagrid,' he said, 'everyone does.
'Er – no,' said Harry.
Hagrid looked shocked.
'Sorry,' Harry said quickly.
asked Harry.
Hagrid thundered.
'I know some things,' he said.
Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode.
Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.
he said finally.
said Harry eagerly.
gasped Harry.
'He's not going,' he said.
Hagrid grunted.
said Harry, interested.
'A Muggle,' said Hagrid.
said Harry.
Hagrid shuddered.
'Sorry,' he said.
Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was 
positively beaming at him.
said Hagrid.
asked Harry.
'Hagrid!'
said Harry loudly.
'Um – Hagrid?'
Harry followed Hagrid out on to the rock.
'Flew,' said Hagrid.
Harry asked.
'Course,' said Hagrid.
'Well, so they say,' said Hagrid.
'Good,' said Hagrid.
'Ifyouknow where to go,' said Hagrid.
If Hagrid hadn't pointed it 
 



 
 
out, Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there.
Harry didn't know what to say.
Hagrid was beaming.
said Hagrid.
Come on, Harry.'
Hagrid grinned at Harry.
'Like I said, yeh'd be madtotry an' rob it,' said Hagrid.
Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.
'Morning,' said Hagrid to a free goblin.
Harry asked.
'Can't tellyouthat,' said Hagrid mysteriously.
'Stalagmite's got an "m" in it,' said Hagrid.
'All yours,' smiled Hagrid.
Harry asked.
she said, when Harry started to speak.
'Yes,' said Harry.
'No,' said Harry.
'That's Hagrid,' said Harry, pleased to know something the boy 
didn't.
'He's the gamekeeper,' said Harry.
said Hagrid.
When they had left the shop, he 
said, 'Hagrid, what's Quidditch?'
You-Know-Who was one.'
'You don't have to –' 
'I know I don't have to.
'Don' mention it,' said Hagrid gruffly.
Harry Potter.'
Rubeus Hagrid!
'It was, sir, yes,' said Hagrid.
'Oh, no, sir,' said Hagrid quickly.
Harry tried.
'You all right, Harry?
Yer very quiet,' said Hagrid.
I 
know it's hard.
'I don't know,' said Harry, realising this for the first time.
Ron's new, too.'
'Yes,' said Harry.
'Not to worry,' she said.
Go on, go now before Ron.'
'Er – OK,' said Harry.
said Harry.
'Oh, him,' said Harry.
'Ron, you've got something on your nose.'
said one of 

the twins.
'Shut up,' said Ron.
said their mother.
said one of the 

twins.
And look after Ron.'
'Shut up,' said Ron again.
Know who he is?'
'Harry Potter!'
How do you 
know?'
'Hey Ron.'
And this is Ron, our brother.
'Bye,' said Harry and Ron.
'Are you really Harry Potter?'
Ron blurted out.
Ron 

stared.
'So that's where You-Know-Who –?'
'Yes,' said Harry, 'but I can't remember it.'
said Ron eagerly.
'Wow,' said Ron.
asked Harry, who found Ron just 
as interesting as Ron found him.
'Er – yes, I think so,' said Ron.
'Five,' said Ron.
said Harry.
'You said You-Know-Who's name!'
'Go 
on –' 

'You don't want this, it's all dry,' said Ron.
'No,' said Ron.
said Harry.
said Ron.
said Ron.
'Help yourself,' said Harry.
'He'll turn up,' said Harry.
'Don't know why he's so bothered,' said Ron.
said the girl.
She said all this very fast.
'I'm Ron Weasley,' Ron muttered.
'Harry Potter,' said Harry.
said Hermione.
'Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I 

could if it was me,' said Hermione.
'Whatever house I'm in, I hope she's not in it,' said Ron.
asked Harry.
'Gryffindor,' said Ron.
I don't know what they'll say 
if I'm not.
'Yeah,' said Ron.
Harry stared.
Ron asked.
he said.
'Yes,' said Harry.
He turned back to Harry.
He held out his hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it.
Both Harry and Ron stood up.
'Say that again,' he said.
'I think he's been knocked out,' Ron said to Harry.
'I've heard of his family,' said Ron darkly.
All right there, Harry?'
Harry and Ron were 
followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione.
'The firs'-years, Professor McGonagall,' said Hagrid.
'Thank you, Hagrid.
he asked Ron.
'My old house, 

you know.'
Ron whispered to Harry.
Ron groaned.
'The Harry Potter?'
he said.
'I know who you are!'
said Ron suddenly.
said Ron.
she said.
Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings
.
His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had 
none of Hagrid's warmth.
said Snape suddenly.
'I don't know, sir,' said Harry.
'I don't know, sir.'
'I don't know,' said Harry quietly.
'Cheer up,' said Ron.
Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?'
'Hang on,' he said.
said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles.
Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson.
said Hagrid.
Hagrid asked Ron.
'Hagrid!'
said Harry.
And did 
Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn't want to tell 
Harry?
Harry and Ron jumped to their feet.
'Give that here, Malfoy,' said Harry quietly.
'HARRY POTTER!'
he said.
'Of course he has,' said Ron, wheeling round.
'Crabbe,' he said.
When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.
said Harry.
said Ron.
'Goodbye,' said Ron.
said Ron furiously.
'Come on,' he said to Ron.
'That's your problem,' said Ron.
'I'm coming with you,' she said.
'You've got some nerve –' said Ron loudly.
said Harry sharply.
said Harry.
'Malfoy tricked you,' Hermione said to Harry.
'It's for your own good, you know.'
It was a while before any of them said anything.
said Ron finally.
'No, we don't mind,' he said.
The dog was guarding something ... 
What had Hagrid said?
'Or both,' said Harry.
Ron grinned at Harry.
said Harry.
'Yes, don't stop now,' said Ron, 'it's doing us so much good.'
'Right,' said Wood.
'Never mind,' said Harry quickly.
'Very good,' said Wood.
Ron, however, was to be 
working with Hermione Granger.
It was 
Hermione.
said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable.
'She doesn't know about the troll.'
Harry whispered.
'Good idea,' said Ron nervously.
Harry gasped.
'Hermione!'
they said together.
'I don't think so,' said Harry.
Professor McGonagall was looking at 
Ron and Harry.
Harry looked at Ron, 
who was still standing with his wand in the air.
Harry looked at the 
floor.
Ron dropped his wand.
Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.
Harry, 
Ron and Hermione sat together next to a window.
Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was 
going to ask Snape if he could have it.
Ron asked as Harry joined them.
'No – he wouldn't,' she said.
'I'm with Harry.
I know it.'
'Hagrid!'
'Nope,' said Ron.
'All right there, Harry?'
Harry saw it.
'Can't have,' Hagrid said, his voice shaking.
Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry.
'Come on, Hermione,' Ron muttered desperately.
Ron said.
He was being made a 
cup of strong tea back in Hagrid's hut, with Ron and Hermione.
Harry, Ron and Hermione looked at each other, wondering 
what to tell him.
'I found out something about him,' he told Hagrid.
'How do you know about Fluffy?'
he said.
said Harry eagerly.
'Now, don't ask me any more,' said Hagrid gruffly.
'Rubbish,' said Hagrid again.
'I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I've read all about them!
said Hagrid hotly.
said Harry.
Hagrid looked furious with himself.
'I'll get him,' said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy's back, 'one 
of these days, I'll get him –' 

'I hate them both,' said Harry, 'Malfoy and Snape.'
Hagrid asked.
'Just one,' said Hermione.
said Hagrid, following them out of the Hall.
Hagrid looked shocked.
'We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all,' said 
Hermione.
'Nothing,' said Harry.
said 
Hermione.
'And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,' 
said Ron.
'You too,' said Harry.
'That's friendly,' said Harry.
he said.
'You can keep it,' said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was.
Ron gasped.
said Ron suddenly.
'Nothing,' said Harry.
'Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?'
Harry said nothing.
'You can see them any old time,' said Ron.
said Ron.
'I'm freezing,' said Ron.
'I know it's here somewhere.'
Harry whispered.
he said.
And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.
said Ron.
'Why don't we go down and visit Hagrid?'
'No ... you go ...' 
'I know what you're thinking about, Harry, that mirror.
But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get 

back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him.
'How did you know –?'
Harry thought.
Harry stood up.
Harry stared.
'Don't talk to me for a moment,' said Ron when Harry sat down 
next to him.
'Don't play,' said Hermione at once.
'Say you're ill,' said Ron.
'Really break your leg,' said Ron.
'I can't,' said Harry.
Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit 
with Harry and Ron.
said Ron.
'Dumbledore again,' he said.
Then he looked 

up at Ron and Hermione.
said Ron grumpily.
said Harry and Ron.
said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished.
said Harry.
I'm going to play,' he told Ron and Hermione.
'I know,' Ron snapped.
said Hermione suddenly.
'Harry –!'
said Malfoy.
Ron snapped.
'Come on, Harry!'
'Ron!
Ron!
Harry's won!
'I-I don-t know what you –' 
'You know perfectly well what I mean.'
* 
'Harry where have you been?'
shouted Ron, thumping Harry on 
the back.
'It'll be gone by next Tuesday,' said Ron.
said Hagrid again.
Hagrid shuffled off.
'But it's against our laws,' said Ron.
said Harry.
'Of course there are,' said Ron.
'So what on earth's Hagrid up to?'
said Hermione.
Hagrid called, 'Who is it?'
'Yes,' said Harry.
Hagrid frowned at him.
'O' course I can't,' he said.
'Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do 
know, you know everything that goes on round here,' said 
Hermione in a warm, flattering voice.
Harry and Ron 
beamed at Hermione.
Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he 

was.
said Harry anxiously.
'Hagrid, 
can we have a window open?
'Can't, Harry, sorry,' said Hagrid.
Harry looked at it, too.
'Hagrid – what's that?'
'That's – er ...' 
'Where did you get it, Hagrid?'
'Won it,' said Hagrid.
said 
Hermione.
'Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,' she said.
But Hagrid wasn't listening.
Harry whispered.
Hagrid murmured.
said Hagrid.
'I can't,' said Hagrid.
Harry suddenly turned to Ron.
'Charlie,' he said.
'You're losing it, too,' said Ron.
'I'm Ron, remember?'
said Ron.
'How about it, Hagrid?'
said Harry, hurrying to let her in.
Dear Ron, 

How are you?
'We've got the Invisibility Cloak,' said Harry.
Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.
'It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday,' said Hermione, but 

this didn't soothe Ron at all.
'Harry!'
Only Ron stood by him.
said Harry miserably.
said Ron.
So what do we do, Harry?'
said Harry.
Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn't.
All 
right, Harry, Hermione?'
said Hagrid, frowning at Filch.
Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.
Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.
Harry asked.
'Not fast enough,' said Hagrid.
Hagrid whispered.
Hagrid called.
'Oh, it's you, Ronan,' said Hagrid in relief.
'Good evening to you, Hagrid,' said Ronan.
'Yeah,' said Hagrid, glancing up too.
'Hullo, Bane,' said Hagrid.
'We've heard,' said Hagrid grumpily.
said Harry.
'Hagrid!
Hagrid shouted.
Hagrid was fuming.
'You are the Potter boy,' he said.
'You had better get back to 
Hagrid.
said Firenze.
'Do you mean,' Harry croaked, 'that was Vol–' 
'Harry!
Harry, are you all right?'
Ron hissed.
'I'm not ill,' said Harry.
said Ron sleepily.
'I've just thought of something,' said Harry.
'We've got to go and see Hagrid, now.'
Lucky they found Hagrid, don't you think?
'Yes, please,' said Ron, but Harry cut across him.
Hagrid, I've got to ask you something.
'What did you talk to him about, Hagrid?
'Forget I said it!
'We've got to go to Dumbledore,' said Harry.
'Hagrid told that 
stranger how to get past Fluffy and it was either Snape or 
Voldemort under that cloak – it must've been easy once he'd got 
Hagrid drunk.
'We want to see Professor Dumbledore,' said Hermione, rather 

bravely, Harry and Ron thought.
said Harry frantically.
'How do you know –?'
'But Professor –' 
'Potter, I know what I'm talking about,' she said shortly.
Harry and Ron wheeled round.
'It's obvious,' said Ron.
Harry and Ron went back to the common room.
'I'm sorry, Harry!'
I don't know where 
Snape went.'
Harry said.
said Ron.
said Hermione.
After what McGonagall and Snape 

have said?
Harry shouted.
'You're right, Harry,' said Hermione in a small voice.
said Ron.
Harry and Ron didn't talk much.
'You're going out again,' he said.
'No, no, no,' said Hermione.
'You don't understand,' said Harry, 'this is important.'
said Neville.
'Yes, but not to us,' said Ron in exasperation.
'Neville, you don't 
know what you're doing.'
Harry turned to Hermione.
Harry whispered.
'We had to, Neville, no time to explain,' said Harry.
'Oh, let's kick her, just this once,' Ron whispered in Harry's ear, 
but Harry shook his head.
'Know you're there, even if I can't 
see you.
whispered Ron.
'Well, there you are,' Harry said quietly.
'Don't be stupid,' said Ron.
'We're coming,' said Hermione.
Hermione said anxiously.
said Ron.
'Right,' said Ron.
said Hermione.
Ron bellowed.
Ron whispered.
said Ron.
'Probably,' said Harry.
said Ron.
Harry said suddenly, 'they're keys!
Harry whispered.
said Ron.
said Hermione nervously.
'I think,' said Ron, 'we're going to have to be chessmen.'
Ron turned to the other two.
'I'm going to be a knight,' said Ron.
Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and 
Hermione were in danger.
'Yes ...' said Ron softly, 'it's the only way ...
Harry and Hermione shouted.
snapped Ron.
Harry whispered.
'Snape's,' said Harry.
'Brilliant,' said Hermione.
'Of course not,' said Hermione.
'Got it,' she said.
'You drink that,' said Harry.
'But Harry – what if You-Know-Who's with him?'
said Harry, pointing at his 

scar.
'Hermione!'
'Harry – you're a great wizard, you know.'
said Hermione.
'You drink first,' said Harry.
said Harry anxiously.
gasped Harry.
Harry couldn't take it in.
Harry 
gasped.
'Get out of the way,' he said.
'Harry Potter ...' it whispered.
the face said.
Harry!'
'Good afternoon, Harry,' said Dumbledore.
Harry stared at him.
said Harry blankly.
said Harry.
'No, Harry, he has not.
You will know, one day ... put it from your mind for 
now, Harry.
I know you hate to hear this ... 
when you are ready, you will know.'
'Quirrell said Snape –' 
'Professor Snape, Harry.'
And she let Ron and Hermione in.
'Harry!'
said Ron finally.
said Harry.
'Well, I got back all right,' said Hermione.
He 
already knew – he just said, "Harry's gone after him, hasn't he?"
said Ron.
'No, it isn't,' said Harry thoughtfully.
'Oh good,' said Harry.
It was the 
only thing he didn't know an' I told him!
'Hagrid!'
sobbed Hagrid.
Harry couldn't speak, but Hagrid understood.
'Third – to Mr Harry Potter ...' said Dumbledore.
'Thanks,' said Harry.
'Still famous,' said Ron, grinning at him.
'Not where I'm going, I promise you,' said Harry.
It was Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, but she wasn't 

pointing at Ron.
'Harry Potter!'
she said.
'Very,' said Harry.
Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.
