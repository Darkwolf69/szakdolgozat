'Harry.
'How did you know it was me?'
'I know that,' said Professor McGonagall irritably.
'I 

 



 
 
know ...
I know ...' he said heavily.
'Yes,' said Professor McGonagall.
'Hagrid's bringing him.'
'I would trust Hagrid with my life,' said Dumbledore.
'Hagrid,' said Dumbledore, sounding relieved.
'Yes,' said Dumbledore.
asked Hagrid.
'Yeah,' said Hagrid in a very muffled voice.
'Nearly,' said Harry.
'I know they don't,' said Harry.
Harry stared.
Harry asked.
'No thanks,' said Harry.
'Oh,' he said.
'No,' he said finally.
said Harry.
he said.
'An' here's Harry!'
said the giant.
he said.
'Call me Hagrid,' he said, 'everyone does.
'Er – no,' said Harry.
Hagrid looked shocked.
'Sorry,' Harry said quickly.
asked Harry.
Hagrid thundered.
'I know some things,' he said.
Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.
he said finally.
said Harry eagerly.
'He's not going,' he said.
Hagrid grunted.
said Harry, interested.
'A Muggle,' said Hagrid.
said Harry.
Hagrid shuddered.
'Sorry,' he said.
Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was 
positively beaming at him.
said Hagrid.
asked Harry.
'Hagrid!'
said Harry loudly.
Harry followed Hagrid out on to the rock.
'Flew,' said Hagrid.
Harry asked.
'Course,' said Hagrid.
'Well, so they say,' said Hagrid.
'Good,' said Hagrid.
'Ifyouknow where to go,' said Hagrid.
If Hagrid hadn't pointed it 
 



 
 
out, Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there.
Harry didn't know what to say.
Hagrid was beaming.
said Hagrid.
Come on, Harry.'
Hagrid grinned at Harry.
'Like I said, yeh'd be madtotry an' rob it,' said Hagrid.
Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.
Harry asked.
'Stalagmite's got an "m" in it,' said Hagrid.
'All yours,' smiled Hagrid.
Harry asked.
she said, when Harry started to speak.
'Yes,' said Harry.
'No,' said Harry.
Know what house you'll be in yet?'
'That's Hagrid,' said Harry, pleased to know something the boy 
didn't.
'He's the gamekeeper,' said Harry.
said Hagrid.
When they had left the shop, he 
said, 'Hagrid, what's Quidditch?'
You-Know-Who was one.'
'You don't have to –' 
'I know I don't have to.
'Don' mention it,' said Hagrid gruffly.
Harry Potter.'
Rubeus Hagrid!
'It was, sir, yes,' said Hagrid.
'Oh, no, sir,' said Hagrid quickly.
Harry tried.
'You all right, Harry?
Yer very quiet,' said Hagrid.
I 
know it's hard.
'I don't know,' said Harry, realising this for the first time.
Ron's new, too.'
'Yes,' said Harry.
said Harry.
'Oh, him,' said Harry.
'Shut up,' said Ron.
said their mother.
And look after Ron.'
'Shut up,' said Ron again.
Know who he is?'
'Harry Potter!'
How do you 
know?'
'Hey Ron.'
And this is Ron, our brother.
'Bye,' said Harry and Ron.
Ron blurted out.
Ron 

stared.
'So that's where You-Know-Who –?'
'Yes,' said Harry, 'but I can't remember it.'
said Ron eagerly.
'Wow,' said Ron.
asked Harry, who found Ron just 
as interesting as Ron found him.
'Er – yes, I think so,' said Ron.
'Five,' said Ron.
said Harry.
'You said You-Know-Who's name!'
'Go 
on –' 

'You don't want this, it's all dry,' said Ron.
'No,' said Ron.
said Harry.
said Ron.
said Ron.
'Help yourself,' said Harry.
'He'll turn up,' said Harry.
'Don't know why he's so bothered,' said Ron.
She said all this very fast.
'I'm Ron Weasley,' Ron muttered.
'Harry Potter,' said Harry.
said Hermione.
'Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I 

could if it was me,' said Hermione.
'Whatever house I'm in, I hope she's not in it,' said Ron.
asked Harry.
'Gryffindor,' said Ron.
I don't know what they'll say 
if I'm not.
'Yeah,' said Ron.
Harry stared.
Ron asked.
he said.
'Yes,' said Harry.
He turned back to Harry.
They 
didn't know what was good for them, either.
Both Harry and Ron stood up.
'Say that again,' he said.
'I think he's been knocked out,' Ron said to Harry.
'I've heard of his family,' said Ron darkly.
He turned to Hermione.
All right there, Harry?'
Harry and Ron were 
followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione.
'The firs'-years, Professor McGonagall,' said Hagrid.
'Thank you, Hagrid.
he asked Ron.
'My old house, 

you know.'
Ron whispered to Harry.
'Granger, Hermione!'
Ron groaned.
'The Harry Potter?'
he said.
'I know who you are!'
said Ron suddenly.
said Ron.
she said.
His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had 
none of Hagrid's warmth.
said Snape suddenly.
'I don't know, sir,' said Harry.
He ignored Hermione's hand.
'I don't know, sir.'
'I don't know,' said Harry quietly.
'I think Hermione does, 

though, why don't you try her?'
'Cheer up,' said Ron.
Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?'
said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles.
Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson.
said Hagrid.
Hagrid asked Ron.
'Hagrid!'
said Harry.
And did 
Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn't want to tell 
Harry?
'You don't know you'll make a fool of yourself,' said Ron reasonably
.
Harry and Ron jumped to their feet.
shouted Hermione Granger.
'HARRY POTTER!'
he said.
'Crabbe,' he said.
When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.
said Harry.
It was Hermione Granger.
said Ron.
Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.
'Goodbye,' said Ron.
said Ron furiously.
'Come on,' he said to Ron.
'That's your problem,' said Ron.
'I'm coming with you,' she said.
'You've got some nerve –' said Ron loudly.
said Harry sharply.
said Harry.
'Malfoy tricked you,' Hermione said to Harry.
'It's for your own good, you know.'
It was a while before any of them said anything.
said Ron finally.
'No, we don't mind,' he said.
The dog was guarding something ... 
What had Hagrid said?
'Or both,' said Harry.
Ron grinned at Harry.
said Harry.
'Yes, don't stop now,' said Ron, 'it's doing us so much good.'
'Never mind,' said Harry quickly.
'Very good,' said Wood.
Ron, however, was to be 
working with Hermione Granger.
It was 
Hermione.
said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable.
'I've just thought – Hermione.'
'She doesn't know about the troll.'
Harry whispered.
'Good idea,' said Ron nervously.
'Hermione!'
they said together.
It was Hermione who spoke first.
'I don't think so,' said Harry.
Professor McGonagall was looking at 
Ron and Harry.
Harry looked at Ron, 
who was still standing with his wand in the air.
Ron dropped his wand.
Hermione hung her head.
Hermione left.
Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.
Harry, 
Ron and Hermione sat together next to a window.
Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was 
going to ask Snape if he could have it.
Ron asked as Harry joined them.
Hermione's eyes were wide.
'No – he wouldn't,' she said.
'I'm with Harry.
I know it.'
'Hagrid!'
'Nope,' said Ron.
'All right there, Harry?'
Harry saw it.
'Can't have,' Hagrid said, his voice shaking.
'I knew it,' Hermione gasped.
'He's doing something – jinxing the broom,' said Hermione.
Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry.
'Come on, Hermione,' Ron muttered desperately.
Ron said.
'Hermione and I saw him.
Harry, Ron and Hermione looked at each other, wondering 
what to tell him.
'I found out something about him,' he told Hagrid.
'How do you know about Fluffy?'
he said.
said Harry eagerly.
'Now, don't ask me any more,' said Hagrid gruffly.
'Rubbish,' said Hagrid again.
cried Hermione.
'I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I've read all about them!
said Hagrid hotly.
said Harry.
Hagrid looked furious with himself.
Hagrid asked.
'Just one,' said Hermione.
said Hagrid, following them out of the Hall.
Hagrid looked shocked.
'We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all,' said 
Hermione.
'Nothing,' said Harry.
said 
Hermione.
'And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,' 
said Ron.
'Very safe, as they're both dentists,' said Hermione.
'You too,' said Harry.
'That's friendly,' said Harry.
he said.
'You can keep it,' said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was.
Ron gasped.
said Ron suddenly.
'Nothing,' said Harry.
'Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?'
Harry said nothing.
'You can see them any old time,' said Ron.
said Ron.
'I'm freezing,' said Ron.
'I know it's here somewhere.'
Harry whispered.
he said.
And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.
said Ron.
'Why don't we go down and visit Hagrid?'
'No ... you go ...' 
'I know what you're thinking about, Harry, that mirror.
'You sound like Hermione.'
'How did you know –?'
Harry thought.
Harry stood up.
Harry stared.
'Don't talk to me for a moment,' said Ron when Harry sat down 
next to him.
'Don't play,' said Hermione at once.
'Say you're ill,' said Ron.
'Really break your leg,' said Ron.
'I can't,' said Harry.
Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit 
with Harry and Ron.
Hermione urged Neville.
said Ron.
'Dumbledore again,' he said.
Then he looked 

up at Ron and Hermione.
Hermione jumped to her feet.
said Ron grumpily.
Hermione 

ignored him.
said Harry and Ron.
said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished.
said Harry.
I'm going to play,' he told Ron and Hermione.
'Just as long as we're not wiping you off the pitch,' said 
Hermione.
'I know,' Ron snapped.
said Hermione suddenly.
'Harry –!'
said Malfoy.
Ron snapped.
'Come on, Harry!'
'Ron!
Ron!
Harry's won!
'I-I don-t know what you –' 
'You know perfectly well what I mean.'
* 
'Harry where have you been?'
Hermione squeaked.
said Hermione in alarm.
'It'll be gone by next Tuesday,' said Ron.
said Hagrid again.
Hagrid shuffled off.
said Hermione thoughtfully
.
'But it's against our laws,' said Ron.
said Harry.
'Of course there are,' said Ron.
'So what on earth's Hagrid up to?'
said Hermione.
Hagrid called, 'Who is it?'
'Yes,' said Harry.
'O' course I can't,' he said.
'Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do 
know, you know everything that goes on round here,' said 
Hermione in a warm, flattering voice.
Hermione went on.
Harry and Ron 
beamed at Hermione.
Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he 

was.
said Harry anxiously.
'Hagrid, 
can we have a window open?
'Can't, Harry, sorry,' said Hagrid.
Harry looked at it, too.
'Hagrid – what's that?'
'That's – er ...' 
'Where did you get it, Hagrid?'
'Won it,' said Hagrid.
said 
Hermione.
He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn't.
But Hagrid wasn't listening.
Hermione wouldn't hear of it.
Harry whispered.
Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology, and in the 
end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid's with the other two 
during morning break.
Hagrid murmured.
said Hagrid.
'I can't,' said Hagrid.
Harry suddenly turned to Ron.
'Charlie,' he said.
'You're losing it, too,' said Ron.
'I'm Ron, remember?'
said Ron.
'How about it, Hagrid?'
Dear Ron, 

How are you?
Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.
'It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday,' said Hermione, but 

this didn't soothe Ron at all.
Harry and Hermione didn't get a chance to answer.
Hermione was trembling.
'Harry!'
Only Ron stood by him.
said Harry miserably.
Hermione and Neville were suffering, too.
said Ron.
So what do we do, Harry?'
said Harry.
Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn't.
All 
right, Harry, Hermione?'
said Hagrid, frowning at Filch.
Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.
Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.
Harry asked.
'Not fast enough,' said Hagrid.
'You all right, Hermione?'
Hagrid whispered.
Hagrid called.
'Oh, it's you, Ronan,' said Hagrid in relief.
'Good evening to you, Hagrid,' said Ronan.
This is Harry Potter an' 
Hermione Granger, by the way.
'We'd noticed,' said Hermione faintly.
'Yeah,' said Hagrid, glancing up too.
'Hullo, Bane,' said Hagrid.
'We've heard,' said Hagrid grumpily.
asked Hermione.
said Harry.
'Hagrid!
Hagrid shouted.
whispered 
Hermione.
'You had better get back to 
Hagrid.
said Firenze.
Harry, are you all right?'
Ron hissed.
'I'm not ill,' said Harry.
When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, 'That's just the 
exams.
said Ron sleepily.
'I've just thought of something,' said Harry.
'We've got to go and see Hagrid, now.'
'Yes, please,' said Ron, but Harry cut across him.
Hagrid, I've got to ask you something.
'What did you talk to him about, Hagrid?
'Forget I said it!
'We've got to go to Dumbledore,' said Harry.
'We want to see Professor Dumbledore,' said Hermione, rather 

bravely, Harry and Ron thought.
said Harry frantically.
'How do you know –?'
'But Professor –' 
'Potter, I know what I'm talking about,' she said shortly.
'But what can we –' 
Hermione gasped.
Hermione, you'd better do that.'
'It's obvious,' said Ron.
Harry and Ron went back to the common room.
Harry had just 
said, 'At least Hermione's on Snape's tail,' when the portrait of the 
Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.
I don't know where 
Snape went.'
Harry said.
said Ron.
said Hermione.
After what McGonagall and Snape 

have said?
'You're right, Harry,' said Hermione in a small voice.
said Ron.
'Of course not,' said Hermione briskly.
'Not if I can help it,' said Hermione grimly.
Harry and Ron didn't talk much.
'You're going out again,' he said.
'No, no, no,' said Hermione.
said Neville.
'Neville, you don't 
know what you're doing.'
Harry turned to Hermione.
Hermione stepped forward.
Harry whispered.
'Know you're there, even if I can't 
see you.
whispered Ron.
'Well, there you are,' Harry said quietly.
'Don't be stupid,' said Ron.
'We're coming,' said Hermione.
Hermione whispered.
'Want to go first, Hermione?'
Hermione said anxiously.
said Ron.
'Right,' said Ron.
Come on, Hermione!'
shrieked Hermione.
Hermione ordered them.
said Hermione.
Ron bellowed.
Ron whispered.
said Ron.
'Probably,' said Harry.
said Ron.
'These birds ... they can't be here just for decoration,' said 

Hermione.
Harry said suddenly, 'they're keys!
Harry whispered.
said Ron.
said Hermione nervously.
'I think,' said Ron, 'we're going to have to be chessmen.'
Ron turned to the other two.
'I'm going to be a knight,' said Ron.
Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and 
Hermione were in danger.
'Yes ...' said Ron softly, 'it's the only way ...
Harry and Hermione shouted.
snapped Ron.
Harry whispered.
'Snape's,' said Harry.
'Brilliant,' said Hermione.
'Of course not,' said Hermione.
'But how do we know which to drink?'
'Got it,' she said.
'You drink that,' said Harry.
'But Harry – what if You-Know-Who's with him?'
'Hermione!'
'Harry – you're a great wizard, you know.'
said Hermione.
'You drink first,' said Harry.
'Positive,' said Hermione.
said Harry anxiously.
Harry couldn't take it in.
He was at 

Hogwarts with your father, didn't you know?
'Get out of the way,' he said.
the face said.
Harry!'
'Good afternoon, Harry,' said Dumbledore.
Harry stared at him.
You got Hermione's owl?'
said Harry blankly.
said Harry.
'No, Harry, he has not.
You will know, one day ... put it from your mind for 
now, Harry.
I know you hate to hear this ... 
when you are ready, you will know.'
And she let Ron and Hermione in.
'Harry!'
Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all 
the right places and, when Harry told them what was under 
Quirrell's turban, Hermione screamed out loud.
said Ron finally.
said Harry.
'Well, I got back all right,' said Hermione.
said Ron.
'No, it isn't,' said Harry thoughtfully.
'Oh good,' said Harry.
It was the 
only thing he didn't know an' I told him!
'Hagrid!'
sobbed Hagrid.
'Thanks,' said Harry.
It was Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, but she wasn't 

pointing at Ron.
'Harry Potter!'
she said.
'Very,' said Harry.
Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.
