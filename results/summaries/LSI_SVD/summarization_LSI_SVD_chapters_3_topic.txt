Mr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat.
Mr 
Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his 
mind.
'The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard –' 
'– yes, their son, Harry –' 
Mr Dursley stopped dead.
said Mr Dursley loudly.
Was this normal 
cat behaviour, Mr Dursley wondered.
snapped Mrs Dursley.
'I suppose so,' said Mrs Dursley stiffly.
While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr Dursley crept 
to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden.
Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly but 
Mr Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind.
'Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.'
'You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day,' said 

Professor McGonagall.
Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
'You can't blame them,' said Dumbledore gently.
'I know that,' said Professor McGonagall irritably.
'It certainly seems so,' said Dumbledore.
'No, thank you,' said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though 
she didn't think this was the moment for sherbet lemons.
'I know you haven't,' said Professor McGonagall, sounding halfexasperated
, half-admiring.
'You flatter me,' said Dumbledore calmly.
Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and 

said, 'The owls are nothing to the rumours that are flying around.
Professor McGonagall gasped.
Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on.
faltered Professor McGonagall.
'We can only guess,' said Dumbledore.
'Yes,' said Professor McGonagall.
'Dumbledore – you can't.
'It's the best place for him,' said Dumbledore firmly.
repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back 
down on the wall.
Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, 
swallowed and then said, 'Yes – yes, you're right, of course.
'I would trust Hagrid with my life,' said Dumbledore.
'I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place,' said Professor 

McGonagall grudgingly, 'but you can't pretend he's not careless.
'Hagrid,' said Dumbledore, sounding relieved.
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the 
bundle of blankets.
whispered Professor McGonagall.
'Yes,' said Dumbledore.
'Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?'
hissed Professor McGonagall.
'Well,' said Dumbledore finally, 'that's that.
G'night, Professor McGonagall – Professor 
Dumbledore, sir.'
'I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,' said 
Dumbledore, nodding to her.
Professor McGonagall blew her nose 
in reply.

'Nearly,' said Harry.
Harry didn't look it, but he 
was very fast.
He 
looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he 
had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's and Dudley was about 
four times bigger than he was.
Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over 
the bacon.
About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his 

newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut.
Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon.
Aunt 
Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel – Harry 
often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.
Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began 
wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned 
the table over.
Dudley thought for a moment.
Uncle Vernon chuckled.
Atta 

boy, Dudley!'
He ruffled Dudley's hair.
'Bad news, Vernon,' she said.
Harry hated it there.
said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as 
though he'd planned this.
'We could phone Marge,' Uncle Vernon suggested.
'I won't blow up the house,' said Harry, but they weren't listening.
His aunt and uncle 
hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but 
before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.
'I'm not going to do anything,' said Harry, 'honestly ...' 
But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him.
But all he'd tried to do 
 



 
 
(as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his 
cupboard) was jump behind the big bins outside the kitchen 
doors.
While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia.
He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the 
council, Harry, the bank and Harry were just a few of his favourite 
subjects.
'I had a dream about a motorbike,' said Harry, remembering 
suddenly.
Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front.
Dudley and Piers sniggered.
'I know they don't,' said Harry.
Uncle Vernon tapped 
on the glass, but the snake didn't budge.
'Do it again,' Dudley ordered.
Uncle Vernon rapped the glass 
smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.
The snake jerked its head towards Uncle Vernon and Dudley, 
then raised its eyes to the ceiling.
It gave Harry a look that said 
quite plainly: 'I get that all the time.'
Harry asked.
'DUDLEY!
Dudley came waddling towards them as fast as he could.
'Out of the way, you,' he said, punching Harry in the ribs.
Piers and 
Dudley could only gibber.
As far as Harry had seen, the snake 
hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it 
passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, 
Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while 
Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death.
But worst 
of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, 
'Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?'
Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house 
before starting on Harry.
At school, Harry had no one.

Dudley had a place at 
Uncle Vernon's old school, Smeltings.
'No thanks,' said Harry.
Then he ran, 
before Dudley could work out what he'd said.
As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle 
Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life.
'Your new school uniform,' she said.
'Oh,' he said.
'Get the post, Dudley,' said Uncle Vernon from behind his 
paper.
'Make Harry get it.'
'Get the post, Harry.'
'Make Dudley get it.'
Harry dodged the Smeltings stick and went to get the post.
shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen.
said Dudley suddenly.
said Harry, trying to snatch it back.
'Vernon!
'I want to read that letter,' he said loudly.
'I want to read it,' said Harry furiously, 'as it's mine.'
'Get out, both of you,' croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter 

back inside its envelope.
'But what should we do, Vernon?
'No,' he said finally.
said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had 
squeezed through the door.
It was addressed to you by mistake,' said Uncle 
Vernon shortly.
'It was not a mistake,' said Harry angrily.
said Harry.
The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon 

and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, 
Marge), one where Dudley slept and one where Dudley kept all 
the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom.
Uncle Vernon 
and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.
When the post arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying 
to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it.
Uncle Vernon had to 
wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which 
was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle 
Vernon around the neck from behind.
'Dudley – go – just go.'
Uncle Vernon didn't go to work that day.
'I'm not sure that'll work, Vernon.'
Uncle Vernon stayed at home again.
Dudley asked 
Harry in amazement.
When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with 
their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut.
'I'll take them,' said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and 
following her from the dining-room.
Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling.
he said.
said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping 
his hands together.
'I've already got us some rations,' said Uncle Vernon, 'so all 
aboard!'
he said cheerfully

he said stupidly.
'An' here's Harry!'
said the giant.
he said.
'Anyway – Harry,' said the giant, turning his back on the 
Dursleys, 'a very happy birthday to yeh.
Harry looked up at the giant.
'Call me Hagrid,' he said, 'everyone does.
'Er – no,' said Harry.
'Sorry,' Harry said quickly.
asked Harry.
'I know some things,' he said.
he said finally.
said Harry eagerly.
'Ah, go boilyourheads, both of yeh,' said Hagrid.
'Harry –youra 

wizard.'
gasped Harry.
'He's not going,' he said.
said Harry, interested.
'A Muggle,' said Hagrid.
'You knew?'
said Harry.
'You knew I'm a – a wizard?'
'Knew!'
'Knew!
Of course we 

knew!
Harry had gone very white.
Harry asked urgently.
Harry suggested.
Dark days, Harry.
'Now,yourmum an' dad were as good a witch an' wizard as I 
ever knew.
'Sorry,' he said.
'Good question, Harry.
A wizard?
I don't think I can be a wizard.'
'Not a wizard, eh?
Harry looked into the fire.
said Hagrid.
'Harry Potter, not a wizard – you wait, you'll 
be right famous at Hogwarts.'
asked Harry.
'You can kip under that,' he said.

'Hagrid!'
said Harry loudly.
'Just the one.
'Flew,' said Hagrid.
Harry asked.
Harry asked, before he could stop 
himself. 

'
'Course,' said Hagrid.
'Well, so they say,' said Hagrid.
'You'd like one?'
'Good,' said Hagrid.
'Ifyouknow where to go,' said Hagrid.
Harry didn't know what to say.
said Hagrid.
Come on, Harry.'
Hagrid grinned at Harry.
'Like I said, yeh'd be madtotry an' rob it,' said Hagrid.
Harry asked.
'Can't tellyouthat,' said Hagrid mysteriously.
'Stalagmite's got an "m" in it,' said Hagrid.
'One speed only,' said Griphook.
Harry asked.
'Yes,' said Harry.
'No,' said Harry.
'That's Hagrid,' said Harry, pleased to know something the boy 
didn't.
'He's the gamekeeper,' said Harry.
said Hagrid.
When they had left the shop, he 
said, 'Hagrid, what's Quidditch?'
You-Know-Who was one.'
'You don't have to –' 
'I know I don't have to.
'Don' mention it,' said Hagrid gruffly.
Harry Potter.'
'It was, sir, yes,' said Hagrid.
'Good wand, that one.
'Oh, no, sir,' said Hagrid quickly.
Try this one.
Harry tried.
Harry took the wand.
'You all right, Harry?
Yer very quiet,' said Hagrid.
'All those people in 
the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr Ollivander ... but I 
don't know anything about magic at all.

'I don't know,' said Harry, realising this for the first time.
'Yes,' said Harry.
said Harry.
'Oh, him,' said Harry.
'Shut up,' said Ron.
said their mother.
'Shut up,' said Ron again.
Know who he is?'
'Harry Potter!'
How do you 
know?'
'Bye,' said Harry and Ron.
And have you really got – you know ...' 
He pointed at Harry's forehead.
'So that's where You-Know-Who –?'
'Yes,' said Harry, 'but I can't remember it.'
said Ron eagerly.
'Wow,' said Ron.
'Er – yes, I think so,' said Ron.
'Five,' said Ron.
said Harry.
'You said You-Know-Who's name!'
'Go 
on –' 

'You don't want this, it's all dry,' said Ron.
'No,' said Ron.
said Harry.
said Ron.
said Ron.
'Help yourself,' said Harry.
'He'll turn up,' said Harry.
'Don't know why he's so bothered,' said Ron.
'I'm Ron Weasley,' Ron muttered.
'Harry Potter,' said Harry.
'Do either of you know what 
house you'll be in?
'Gryffindor,' said Ron.
I don't know what they'll say 
if I'm not.
'Yeah,' said Ron.
Ron asked.
'Er – I don't know any,' Harry confessed.
he said.
'Yes,' said Harry.
They 
didn't know what was good for them, either.
'I think he's been knocked out,' Ron said to Harry.

'The firs'-years, Professor McGonagall,' said Hagrid.
'Welcome to Hogwarts,' said Professor McGonagall.
'I shall return when we are ready for you,' said Professor 
McGonagall.
he asked Ron.
Any second 
now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his 
doom.
said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them.
said the Friar.
'Move along now,' said a sharp voice.
Professor McGonagall had returned.
'Now, form a line,' Professor McGonagall told the first-years, 

'and follow me.'
Professor McGonagall led 
the first-years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing 
the other students, with the teachers behind them.
Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall 
silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first-years.
Ron whispered to Harry.
shouted the hat.
Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at 
once, but at others it took a little while to decide.
shouted the hat.
What 
if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until 
Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had 
obviously been a mistake and he'd better get back on the train?
'The Harry Potter?'
'Hmm,' said a small voice in his ear.
said the small voice.
Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole Hall.
Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a 
second later the hat had shouted, 'GRYFFINDOR!'
'Well done, Ron, excellent,' said Percy Weasley pompously 
across Harry as 'Zabini, Blaise' was made a Slytherin.
Professor 
McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.
he said.
he asked Percy uncertainly.
said Percy airily.
said Ron suddenly.
'Like this,' he said irritably.
'I've never asked,' said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.
said Ron.
Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore.
asked Percy.
'Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?'
he asked 
Percy.
'Must be,' said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore.
he said, with an evil cackle.
'You want to watch out for Peeves,' said Percy, as they set off 
again.
she said.
Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings

'Double Potions with the Slytherins,' said Ron.
'Wish McGonagall favoured us,' said Harry.
Dear Harry, (it said, in a very untidy scrawl) 

I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to 
come and have a cup of tea with me around three?
At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had got the idea that 
Professor Snape disliked him.
Snape didn't dislike Harry – he 
hated him.
Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the register, and 
like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name.
'Ah, yes,' he said softly, 'Harry Potter.
His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had 
none of Hagrid's warmth.
said Snape suddenly.
Harry glanced at 
Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione's hand had shot 
into the air.
'I don't know, sir,' said Harry.
'I don't know, sir.'
Snape was still ignoring Hermione's quivering hand.
'I don't know,' said Harry quietly.
Over 
the noise, Snape said, 'And a point will be taken from Gryffindor 
house for your cheek, Potter.'
He'd lost two 
points for Gryffindor in his very first week – why did Snape hate 
him so much?
'Cheer up,' said Ron.
Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?'
Then Hagrid's voice rang out, 
saying, 'Back, Fang – back.'
'Hang on,' he said.
'Make yerselves at home,' said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who 
bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears.
Like Hagrid, 
Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.
'This is Ron,' Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water 
into a large teapot and putting rock cakes on to a plate.
said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles.
The rock cakes almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron 
pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their 
first lessons.
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch 'that old 
git'.
Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson.
Hagrid, like Ron, told 
Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the 
students.
said Hagrid.
Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet 

his eyes when he said that.
Hagrid asked Ron.
Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose.
While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, 
Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under 
the tea cosy.
'But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your 
noses out if you know what's good for you,' said a Gringotts 
spokesgoblin this afternoon.
'Hagrid!'
said Harry.
There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet 
Harry's eyes this time.
As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their 
pockets weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to 
refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had 
given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid.
Had Hagrid 
collected that package just in time?
And did 
Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn't want to tell 
Harry?

'Typical,' said Harry darkly.
'You don't know you'll make a fool of yourself,' said Ron reasonably
.
'What's going on?'
'Give that here, Malfoy,' said Harry quietly.
'HARRY POTTER!'
thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was 
going to use on him?
'Out, Peeves!'
he said.
'Wood 
told me.'
'Wood told us.
You must be good, Harry, Wood was 
almost skipping when he told us.'
'I'd take you on any time on my own,' said Malfoy.
'Of course he has,' said Ron, wheeling round.
'Crabbe,' he said.
When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.
said Harry.
said Ron.
'Goodbye,' said Ron.
said Ron furiously.
'Come on,' he said to Ron.
'Now what am I going to do?'
'That's your problem,' said Ron.
'I'm coming with you,' she said.
'You've got some nerve –' said Ron loudly.
said Harry sharply.
said Harry.
'Malfoy tricked you,' Hermione said to Harry.
He was never going to meet you – Filch knew someone 
was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him 
off.'
Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn't going to 
tell her that.
It was Peeves.
'Shut up, Peeves – please – you'll get us thrown out.'
Peeves cackled.
'Not if you don't give us away, Peeves, please.'
Peeves bellowed.
'Which way did they go, Peeves?'
'Don't mess me about, Peeves, now where did they go?'
'Shan't say nothing if you don't say please,' said Peeves in his 

annoying sing-song voice.
It was a while before any of them said anything.
said Ron finally.
'No, we don't mind,' he said.

'Or both,' said Harry.
Professor M. McGonagall 
 

Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron 
to read.
Ron grinned at Harry.
said Harry.
Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.
'Very nice,' said Wood, his eyes glinting.
'Right,' said Wood.
'This ball's called the Quaffle,' said Wood.
said Wood curiously.
'Never mind,' said Harry quickly.
'Three Chasers, one Keeper,' said Harry, who was determined to 
remember it all.
'I'll show you now,' said Wood.
'I'm going to show you what the Bludgers do,' Wood said.
'Very good,' said Wood.
'This,' said Wood, 'is the Golden Snitch, and it's the most 
important ball of the lot.
'We won't practise with the Snitch yet,' said Wood, carefully 

shutting it back inside the crate.
Ron, however, was to be 
working with Hermione Granger.
It was hard to tell whether Ron 
or Hermione was angrier about this.
'You're saying it wrong,' Harry heard Hermione snap.
It was 
Hermione.
said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable.
'I've just thought – Hermione.'
'He's heading for the third floor,' Harry said, but Ron held up 

his hand.
'Hermione!'
they said together.
Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, 
looking as if she was about to faint.
The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione.
It was Hermione who spoke first.
'I don't think so,' said Harry.
Professor McGonagall was looking at 
Ron and Harry.
Harry looked at Ron, 
who was still standing with his wand in the air.
Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.
Ron dropped his wand.
Hermione Granger, telling a downright 

lie to a teacher?
Harry stuck his wand 

up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club.
Hermione hung her head.
Hermione left.
Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.
'Five, you mean, once she's taken off Hermione's.'
But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their 
friend.

Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping.
Harry showed him.
Harry, 
Ron and Hermione sat together next to a window.
Hermione was 
checking Harry and Ron's Charms homework for them.
Harry felt restless.
Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was 
going to ask Snape if he could have it.
Harry gulped.
Ron asked as Harry joined them.
'No – he wouldn't,' she said.
'Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something
,' snapped Ron.
'I'm with Harry.
Harry felt terrible.
'Harry, you need your strength,' said Seamus Finnigan.
'OK, men,' he said.
'The one we've all been waiting for,' said George.
'Shut up, you two,' said Wood.
Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough 

space to join them.
'Nope,' said Ron.
'All right there, Harry?'
Harry saw it.
A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below – 
Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose and Harry's broom 
span off course, Harry holding on for dear life.
Harry's 
broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it.
'Can't have,' Hagrid said, his voice shaking.
'He's doing something – jinxing the broom,' said Hermione.
Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared
.
Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry.
'Come on, Hermione,' Ron muttered desperately.
Ron said.
He was being made a 
cup of strong tea back in Hagrid's hut, with Ron and Hermione.
'It was Snape,' Ron was explaining.
'Hermione and I saw him.
'Rubbish,' said Hagrid, who hadn't heard a word of what had 
gone on next to him in the stands.
Harry, Ron and Hermione looked at each other, wondering 
what to tell him.
he said.
said Harry eagerly.
'Now, don't ask me any more,' said Hagrid gruffly.
'Rubbish,' said Hagrid again.
'So why did he just try and kill Harry?'
said Hagrid hotly.
said Harry.

'I'll get him,' said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy's back, 'one 
of these days, I'll get him –' 

'I hate them both,' said Harry, 'Malfoy and Snape.'
'Just one,' said Hermione.
'Nothing,' said Harry.
said 
Hermione.
'And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,' 
said Ron.
'You too,' said Harry.
'Will you look at this?
'That's friendly,' said Harry.
he said.
'You can keep it,' said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was.
'It's an Invisibility Cloak,' said Ron, a look of awe on his face.
Look down!'
said Ron suddenly.
'I'd give anything for one of these,' he said.
'Nothing,' said Harry.
Harry said nothing.
His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and 
Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself 
but see no reflection again.
It 
stuck up at the back, just like Harry's did.
And slowly, Harry looked 

into the faces of the other people in the mirror and saw other 
pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old 
man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees – Harry 
was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.
* 
'You could have woken me up,' said Ron, crossly.
'I'd like to see your mum and dad,' Ron said eagerly.
'You can see them any old time,' said Ron.
said Ron.
'You look odd.'
'I'm freezing,' said Ron.
'See?'
'Look!
Look at them all ... there are loads of them ...' 

 



 
 

'I can only see you.'
'Look at me!'
he said.
And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.
said Ron.
'No ... you go ...' 
'I know what you're thinking about, Harry, that mirror.
So what if they can't see you?
But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get 

back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him.
Except – 
'So – back again, Harry?'
Harry thought.
Harry stood up.
'What do you see when you look in the Mirror?'
Harry stared.

'You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you 
mad,' said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.
'Don't talk to me for a moment,' said Ron when Harry sat down 
next to him.
'Don't play,' said Hermione at once.
'Say you're ill,' said Ron.
'Really break your leg,' said Ron.
'I can't,' said Harry.
Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit 
with Harry and Ron.
'Malfoy,' said Neville shakily.
said Ron.
'You're worth twelve of Malfoy,' Harry said.
And where's Malfoy?
'Thanks, Harry ...
'Dumbledore again,' he said.
Then he looked 

up at Ron and Hermione.
said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she'd 
looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the 
pages, muttering to herself.
said Ron grumpily.
said Harry and Ron.
said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished.
said Harry.
It wasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch 
team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.
I'm going to play,' he told Ron and Hermione.
'I know,' Ron snapped.
It was Malfoy.
said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded 
Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all.
'I'm worth twelve of you, Malfoy,' he stammered.
Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still 

not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, 'You tell him, 
Neville.'
said Hermione suddenly.
'Harry –!'
said Malfoy.
Ron snapped.
'Come on, Harry!'
'Ron!
Ron!
Harry's won!
'Well done,' said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could 
hear.
* 
'Harry where have you been?'
shouted Ron, thumping Harry on 
the back.
'Never mind that now,' said Harry breathlessly.
said Hermione in alarm.
'It'll be gone by next Tuesday,' said Ron.

said Hagrid again.
Hagrid shuffled off.
said Hermione thoughtfully
.
'But it's against our laws,' said Ron.
said Harry.
'Of course there are,' said Ron.
'So what on earth's Hagrid up to?'
said Hermione.
Hagrid called, 'Who is it?'
'Yes,' said Harry.
Hagrid frowned at him.
'O' course I can't,' he said.
Harry and Ron 
beamed at Hermione.
Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he 

was.
said Harry anxiously.
'Can't, Harry, sorry,' said Hagrid.
Harry looked at it, too.
'Hagrid – what's that?'
'Won it,' said Hagrid.
said 
Hermione.
'Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,' she said.
But Hagrid wasn't listening.
Hagrid murmured.
said Hagrid.
'I can't,' said Hagrid.
Norbert!
Norbert!
'Charlie,' he said.
'You're losing it, too,' said Ron.
We could send Norbert to him.
said Ron.
'How about it, Hagrid?'
said Harry, hurrying to let her in.
'We've got the Invisibility Cloak,' said Harry.
Anything to get rid of Norbert – and Malfoy.
Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.
'It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday,' said Hermione, but 

this didn't soothe Ron at all.
Harry and Hermione didn't get a chance to answer.
'We 
haven't got time to send Charlie another owl and this could be 
our only chance to get rid of Norbert.
They showed Harry and 
Hermione the harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend 
Norbert between them.

'Harry!'
said Harry miserably.
'All right – all right –' he heard Quirrell sob.
said Ron.
So what do we do, Harry?'
said Harry.
Right, off 
we go, and don't think of running off, now, it'll be worse for you if 
you do.'
All 
right, Harry, Hermione?'
'I shouldn't be too friendly to them, Hagrid,' said Filch coldly, 
'they're here to be punished, after all.'
said Hagrid, frowning at Filch.
'Yeh are ifyouwanttostay at Hogwarts,' said Hagrid fiercely.
'All right, but I warn yeh, he's a coward,' said Hagrid.
A little way into it they 
reached a fork in the earth path and Harry, Hermione and Hagrid 
took the left path while Malfoy, Neville and Fang took the right.
Harry asked.
'Not fast enough,' said Hagrid.
'You all right, Hermione?'
Harry suggested.
'That wasn' no werewolf an' it wasn' no unicorn, neither,' said 

Hagrid grimly.
'Right, follow me, but careful, now.'
'Oh, it's you, Ronan,' said Hagrid in relief.
'Good evening to you, Hagrid,' said Ronan.
'Can't be too careful, Ronan,' said Hagrid, patting his crossbow.
'Good evening,' said Ronan.
'Yeah,' said Hagrid, glancing up too.
'Yeah,' said Hagrid, 'but haveyouseen anythin', Ronan?
'Hullo, Bane,' said Hagrid.
'All right?'
'We've heard,' said Hagrid grumpily.
said Harry.
'Hagrid!
Right, we're changin' groups – Neville, you stay with 
me an' Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an' this idiot.
It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead.
'Are you all right?'
said Firenze.
'Do you mean,' Harry croaked, 'that was Vol–' 
'Harry!
Harry, are you all right?'
'Good luck, Harry Potter,' said Firenze.
Harry couldn't sit down.
Harry wasn't listening.
Anyway, who says the centaurs are right?

said Ron sleepily.
'We've got to go to Dumbledore,' said Harry.
Hermione, you'd better do that.'
'It's obvious,' said Ron.
Harry said.
said Ron.
said Hermione.
'You're right, Harry,' said Hermione in a small voice.
said Ron.
'Of course not,' said Hermione briskly.
'No, no, no,' said Hermione.
said Neville.
Harry turned to Hermione.
Harry whispered.
'Don't be stupid,' said Ron.
'We're coming,' said Hermione.
Hermione whispered.
Hermione said anxiously.
said Ron.
'Right,' said Ron.
Come on, Hermione!'
said Hermione.
said Ron.
said Ron.
Harry whispered.
said Ron.
said Hermione nervously.
'I think,' said Ron, 'we're going to have to be chessmen.'
'I'm going to be a knight,' said Ron.
Harry and Hermione shouted.
Harry whispered.
'Snape's,' said Harry.
'Brilliant,' said Hermione.
'Of course not,' said Hermione.
'You drink that,' said Harry.
'But Harry – what if You-Know-Who's with him?'
'Hermione!'
said Hermione.
'Positive,' said Hermione.
said Harry anxiously.

gasped Harry.
Harry couldn't take it in.
'I see the Stone ...
Harry 
gasped.
said Quirrell impatiently.
'What do you see?'
What did you just see?'
the face said.
Quirrell screamed and tried to throw 
Harry off – the pain in Harry's head was building – he couldn't see 
– he could only hear Quirrell's terrible shrieks and Voldemort's 
yells of 'KILL HIM!
and other voices, maybe in 
Harry's own head, crying, 'Harry!
Harry!'
'Good afternoon, Harry,' said Dumbledore.
Harry stared at him.
The Stone!
It 

was Quirrell!
He's got the Stone!
'Quirrell does not have the Stone.'
'But sir, the Stone –' 
'I see you are not to be distracted.
Very well, the Stone.
said Harry blankly.
said Harry.
'No, Harry, he has not.
'Yes ...' said Dumbledore dreamily.
'How did I get the Stone out of the Mirror?'
'Harry!'
Harry told 
them everything: Quirrell; the Mirror; the Stone and Voldemort.
said Ron finally.
'That's what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that – what was 
it?
said Harry.
said Ron.
'No, it isn't,' said Harry thoughtfully.
'Oh good,' said Harry.
Dumbledore said cheerfully.
'Ahem,' said Dumbledore.
'Third – to Mr Harry Potter ...' said Dumbledore.
'Thanks,' said Harry.
'Not where I'm going, I promise you,' said Harry.
'Harry Potter!'
she said.
'Very,' said Harry.
